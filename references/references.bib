This seminal study was the first to prove that bracoviruses derive from the Nudiviridae. The authors identified nudivirus-like genes in regions of the wasp genome not associated with the DNAs that are packaged into virions. However, genes of viral origin were transcribed specifically in wasp reproductive tracts and their products were detected in bracovirus virions.

We describe a novel endogenous virus in braconid wasps derived from pathogenic alphanudiviruses. Limited to a subset of the genus Fopius, this recent acquisition allows an unprecedented opportunity to examine early endogenization events. Massive amounts of virus-like particles (VLPs) are produced in wasp ovaries. Unlike most endogenous viruses of parasitoid wasps, the VLPs do not contain DNA, translating to major differences in parasitism-promoting strategies. Rapid changes include genomic rearrangement, loss of DNA processing proteins, and wasp control of viral gene expression. These events precede the full development of tissue-speciﬁc viral gene expression observed in older associations. These data indicate that viral endogenization can rapidly result in functional and evolutionary changes associated with genomic novelty and adaptation in parasitoids.},

In this study, the authors identified the viral ancestor ofV. canescens was a nudivirus. V. canescens belongs to a lineage of ichneumonid wasps that harbor ichnoviruses. The authors therefore identified the first example of the replacement of one EVE by another. 
One species of ichneumonid wasp,Venturia canescens (Gravenhorst, 1829), has lost its ichnovirusand acquired an association with an endogenous nudivirusthat makes virus-like particles (VcVLPs; Pichon et al. 2015).Whereas VcVLP nudivirus-like genes are dispersed in the V. canescens genome, unlike bracoviruses, no proviral genomesegments are present. The virus-like particles (VLPs) produceddo not contain DNA and function as liposomes that delivervirulence proteins into hosts (

	abstract = {Many thousands of endoparasitic wasp species are known to inject polydnavirus (PDV) particles into their caterpillar host during oviposition, causing immune and developmental dysfunctions that benefit the wasp larva. PDVs associated with braconid and ichneumonid wasps, bracoviruses and ichnoviruses respectively, both deliver multiple circular dsDNA molecules to the caterpillar. These molecules contain virulence genes but lack core genes typically involved in particle production. This is not completely unexpected given that no PDV replication takes place in the caterpillar. Particle production is confined to the wasp ovary where viral DNAs are generated from proviral copies maintained within the wasp genome. We recently showed that the genes involved in bracovirus particle production reside within the wasp genome and are related to nudiviruses. In the present work we characterized genes involved in ichnovirus particle production by analyzing the components of purified Hyposoter didymator Ichnovirus particles by LC-MS/MS and studying their organization in the wasp genome. Their products are conserved among ichnovirus-associated wasps and constitute a specific set of proteins in the virosphere. Strikingly, these genes are clustered in specialized regions of the wasp genome which are amplified along with proviral DNA during virus particle replication, but are not packaged in the particles. Clearly our results show that ichnoviruses and bracoviruses particles originated from different viral entities, thus providing an example of convergent evolution where two groups of wasps have independently domesticated viruses to deliver genes into their hosts.},

This study describes the genes of viral origin that are used to produce ichnoviruses in ichneumonid wasps. The genes are arranged in clusters in the wasp genome and have very little to no similarity with genes in non- endogenous viruses, suggesting that the viral ancestor of ichnoviruses has not yet been discovered or is extinct.
In the case of ichnoviruses, the battery of viral genes involved in particle production have been identified, they are organized in clusters named IVSPERs (for Ichnovirus Encoding Structural Regions) but they do not resemble any genes of a known pathogenic virus (Volkoff et al., 2010, 2012). Although their products have been proven to be components of the particles it is difficult to extrapolate more precisely what their function is in the virus cycle (Volkoff et al., 2010).

	abstract = {Polydnaviruses (PDVs) are compelling examples of viral domestication, in which wasps express a large set of genes originating from a chromosomally integrated virus to produce particles necessary for their reproductive success. Parasitoid wasps generally use PDVs as a virulence gene delivery system allowing the protection of their progeny in the body of parasitized host. However, in the wasp Venturia canescens an independent viral domestication process led to an alternative strategy as the wasp incorporates virulence proteins in viral liposomes named virus-like particles (VLPs), instead of DNA molecules. Proteomic analysis of puriﬁed VLPs and transcriptome sequencing revealed the loss of some viral functions. In particular, the genes coding for capsid components are no longer expressed, which explains why VLPs do not incorporate DNA. Here a thorough examination of V. canescens genome revealed the presence of the pseudogenes corresponding to most of the genes involved in lost functions. This strongly suggests that an accumulation of mutations that leads to gene speciﬁc pseudogenization precedes the loss of viral genes observed during virus domestication. No evidence was found for block loss of collinear genes, although extensive gene order reshufﬂing of the viral genome was identiﬁed from comparisons between endogenous and exogenous viruses. These results provide the ﬁrst insights on the early stages of large DNA virus domestication implicating massive genome reduction through gene-speciﬁc pseudogenization, a process which differs from the large deletions described for bacterial endosymbionts.},

	abstract = {Viruses are usually thought to form parasitic associations with hosts, but all members of the family Polydnaviridae are obligate mutualists of insects called parasitoid wasps. Phylogenetic data founded on sequence comparisons of viral genes indicate that polydnaviruses in the genus Bracovirus (BV) are closely related to pathogenic nudiviruses and baculoviruses. However, pronounced differences in the biology of BVs and baculoviruses together with high divergence of many shared genes make it unclear whether BV homologs still retain baculovirus-like functions. Here we report that virions from Microplitis demolitor bracovirus (MdBV) contain multiple baculovirus-like and nudivirus-like conserved gene products. We further show that RNA interference effectively and specifically knocks down MdBV gene expression. Coupling RNAi knockdown methods with functional assays, we examined the activity of six genes in the MdBV conserved gene set that are known to have essential roles in transcription (lef-4, lef-9), capsid assembly (vp39, vlf-1), and envelope formation (p74, pif-1) during baculovirus replication. Our results indicated that MdBV produces a baculovirus-like RNA polymerase that transcribes virus structural genes. Our results also supported a conserved role for vp39, vlf-1, p74, and pif-1 as structural components of MdBV virions. Additional experiments suggested that vlf-1 together with the nudivirus-like gene int-1 also have novel functions in regulating excision of MdBV proviral DNAs for packaging into virions.

	abstract = {The family Polydnaviridae is of interest because it provides the best example of viruses that have evolved a mutualistic association with their animal hosts. Polydnaviruses in the genus Bracovirus are strictly associated with parasitoid wasps in the family Braconidae, and evolved ,100 million years ago from a nudivirus. Each wasp species relies on its associated bracovirus to parasitize hosts, while each bracovirus relies on its wasp for vertical transmission. Prior studies establish that bracovirus genomes consist of proviral segments and nudivirus-like replication genes, but how these components are organized in the genomes of wasps is unknown. Here, we sequenced the genome of the wasp Microplitis demolitor to characterize the proviral genome of M. demolitor bracovirus (MdBV). Unlike nudiviruses, bracoviruses produce virions that package multiple circular, double-stranded DNAs. DNA segments packaged into MdBV virions resided in eight dispersed loci in the M. demolitor genome. Each proviral segment was bounded by homologous motifs that guide processing to form mature viral DNAs. Rapid evolution of proviral segments obscured homology between other bracovirus-carrying wasps and MdBV. However, some domains flanking MdBV proviral loci were shared with other species. All MdBV genes previously identified to encode proteins required for replication were identified. Some of these genes resided in a multigene cluster but others, including subunits of the RNA polymerase that transcribes structural genes and integrases that process proviral segments, were widely dispersed in the M. demolitor genome. Overall, our results indicate that genome dispersal is a key feature in the evolution of bracoviruses into mutualists.},

	abstract = {A large double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) virus that produces occlusion bodies, typical of baculoviruses, has been described to infect crane fly larvae of the genus Tipula (Diptera, Tipulidae). Because of a lack of genomic data, this virus has remained unclassified. Electron microscopy of an archival virus isolated from Tipula oleracea, T. oleracea nudivirus (ToNV), showed irregularly shaped occlusion bodies measuring from 2 to 5 μm in length and 2 μm in middiameter, filled with rod-shape virions containing single nucleocapsids within a bilayer envelope. Whole-genome amplification and Roche 454 sequencing revealed a complete circular genome sequence of 145.7 kb, containing five direct repeat regions. We predicted 131 open reading frames, including a homolog of the polyhedrin gene encoding the major occlusion body protein of T. paludosa nucleopolyhedrovirus (NPV). BLAST searches demonstrated that ToNV had 21 of the 37 baculovirus core genes but shared 52 genes with nudiviruses (NVs). Phylogenomic analyses indicated that ToNV clearly belongs to the Nudiviridae family but should probably be assigned to a new genus. Among nudiviruses, ToNV was most closely related to the Penaeus monodon NV and Heliothis zea NV clade but distantly related to Drosophila innubia NV, the other nudivirus infecting a Diptera. Lastly, ToNV was found to be most closely related to the nuvidirus ancestor of bracoviruses. This was also reflected in terms of gene content, as ToNV was the only known exogenous virus harboring homologs of the Cc50C22.6 and 27b (Cc50C22.7) genes found in the nudiviral genomic cluster involved in bracovirus particle production.
IMPORTANCE: The Nudiviridae is a family of arthropod dsDNA viruses from which striking cases of endogenization have been reported (i.e., symbiotic bracoviruses deriving from a nudivirus and the endogenous nudivirus of the brown planthopper). Although related to baculoviruses, relatively little is known about the genomic diversity of exogenous nudiviruses. Here, we characterized, morphologically and genetically, an archival sample of the Tipula oleracea nudivirus (ToNV), which has the particularity of forming occlusion bodies. Comparative genomic and phylogenomic analyses showed ToNV to be to date the closest known relative of the exogenous ancestor of bracoviruses and that ToNV should be assigned to a new genus. Moreover, we revised the homology relationships of nudiviral genes and identified a new set of 32 core genes for the Nudiviridae, of which 21 were also baculovirus core genes. These findings provide important insights into the evolutionary history of large arthropod dsDNA viruses.},

	abstract = {The nonsynonymous/synonymous rate ratio (x = dN/dS) is an important measure of the mode and strength of natural selection acting on nonsynonymous mutations in protein-coding genes. The simplest such analysis is the estimation of the dN/dS ratio using two sequences. Both heuristic counting methods and the maximum-likelihood (ML) method based on a codon substitution model are widely used for such analysis. However, these methods do not have nice statistical properties, as the estimates can be zero or inﬁnity in some data sets, so that their means and variances are inﬁnite. In large genome-scale comparisons, such extreme estimates (either 0 or 1) of x and sequence distance (t) are common. Here, we implement a Bayesian method to estimate x and t in pairwise sequence comparisons. Using a combination of computer simulation and real data analysis, we show that the Bayesian estimates have better statistical properties than the ML estimates, because the prior on x and t shrinks the posterior of those parameters away from extreme values. We also calculate the posterior probability for x {\textgreater} 1 as a Bayesian alternative to the likelihood ratio test. The new method is computationally efﬁcient and may be useful for genome-scale comparisons of protein-coding gene sequences.},

	abstract = {Background: Bracoviruses (BVs), a group of double-stranded DNA viruses with segmented genomes, are mutualistic endosymbionts of parasitoid wasps. Virus particles are replication deficient and are produced only by female wasps from proviral sequences integrated into the wasp genome. Virus particles are injected along with eggs into caterpillar hosts, where viral gene expression facilitates parasitoid survival and therefore perpetuation of proviral DNA. Here we describe a 223 kbp region of Glyptapanteles indiensis genomic DNA which contains a part of the G. indiensis bracovirus (GiBV) proviral genome.
Results: Eighteen of {\textasciitilde}24 GiBV viral segment sequences are encoded by 7 non-overlapping sets of BAC clones, revealing that some proviral segment sequences are separated by long stretches of intervening DNA. Two overlapping BACs, which contain a locus of 8 tandemly arrayed proviral segments flanked on either side by {\textasciitilde}35 kbp of non-packaged DNA, were sequenced and annotated. Structural and compositional analyses of this cluster revealed it exhibits a G+C and nucleotide composition distinct from the flanking DNA. By analyzing sequence polymorphisms in the 8 GiBV viral segment sequences, we found evidence for widespread selection acting on both protein-coding and non-coding DNA. Comparative analysis of viral and proviral segment sequences revealed a sequence motif involved in the excision of proviral genome segments which is highly conserved in two other bracoviruses.
Conclusion: Contrary to current concepts of bracovirus proviral genome organization our results demonstrate that some but not all GiBV proviral segment sequences exist in a tandem array. Unexpectedly, non-coding DNA in the 8 proviral genome segments which typically occupies {\textasciitilde}70\% of BV viral genomes is under selection pressure suggesting it serves some function(s). We hypothesize that selection acting on GiBV proviral sequences maintains the genetic islandlike nature of the cluster of proviral genome segments described herein. In contrast to large differences in the predicted gene composition of BV genomes, sequences that appear to mediate processes of viral segment formation, such as proviral segment excision and circularization, appear to be highly conserved, supporting the hypothesis of a single origin for BVs.},

BV particles are produced by wasp ovaries and injected along with the eggs into the caterpillar host body, where viral gene expression is necessary for wasp development. Recent sequencing of the proviral genome of Cotesia congregata BV (CcBV) identiﬁed 222 predicted virulence genes present on 35 proviral segments integrated into the wasp genome. To date, the expressions of only a few selected candidate virulence genes have been studied in the caterpillar host, and we lacked a global vision of viral gene expression. In this study, a large-scale transcriptomic analysis by 454 sequencing of two immune tissues (fat body and hemocytes) of parasitized Manduca sexta caterpillar hosts allowed the detection of expression of 88 CcBV genes expressed 24 h after the onset of parasitism. We linked the expression proﬁles of these genes to several factors, showing that different regulatory mechanisms control viral gene expression in the host. These factors include the presence of signal peptides in encoded proteins, diversiﬁcation of promoter regions, and, more surprisingly, gene position on the proviral genome. Indeed, most genes for which expression could be detected are localized in particular proviral regions globally producing higher numbers of circles. Moreover, this polydnavirus (PDV) transcriptomic analysis also reveals that a majority of CcBV genes possess at least one intron and an arthropod transcription start site, consistent with an insect origin of these virulence genes.},

	abstract = {Background: Gene duplications have been proposed to be the main mechanism involved in genome evolution and in acquisition of new functions. Polydnaviruses (PDVs), symbiotic viruses associated with parasitoid wasps, are ideal model systems to study mechanisms of gene duplications given that PDV genomes consist of virulence genes organized into multigene families. In these systems the viral genome is integrated in a wasp chromosome as a provirus and virus particles containing circular double-stranded DNA are injected into the parasitoids’ hosts and are essential for parasitism success. The viral virulence factors, organized in gene families, are required collectively to induce host immune suppression and developmental arrest. The gene family which encodes protein tyrosine phosphatases (PTPs) has undergone spectacular expansion in several PDV genomes with up to 42 genes.
Results: Here, we present strong indications that PTP gene family expansion occurred via classical mechanisms: by duplication of large segments of the chromosomally integrated form of the virus sequences (segmental duplication), by tandem duplications within this form and by dispersed duplications. We also propose a novel duplication mechanism specific to PDVs that involves viral circle reintegration into the wasp genome. The PTP copies produced were shown to undergo conservative evolution along with episodes of adaptive evolution. In particular recently produced copies have undergone positive selection in sites most likely involved in defining substrate selectivity.
Conclusion: The results provide evidence about the dynamic nature of polydnavirus proviral genomes. Classical and PDV-specific duplication mechanisms have been involved in the production of new gene copies. Selection pressures associated with antagonistic interactions with parasitized hosts have shaped these genes used to manipulate lepidopteran physiology with evidence for positive selection involved in adaptation to host targets.},

Rapidly evolving viral genomes can adapt to this pressure by acquiring genes that counteract host defense mechanisms. For example, many vertebrate DNA viruses have hijacked cellular genes encoding cytokines or cytokine receptors to disrupt host cell communication. Insect viruses express suppressors of RNA interference or apoptosis, highlighting the importance of these cell intrinsic antiviral mechanisms in invertebrates. Here, we report the identification and characterization of a family of proteins encoded by insect DNA viruses that are homologous to a 12-kDa circulating protein encoded by the virus-induced

Although the effect of NF-κB signalling on DNA virus infection in insects has not been directly tested, polydnaviruses, ascoviruses, baculoviruses, and entomopoxviruses have acquired suppressors of NF-κB signalling by horizontal gene transfer, providing indirect evidence for anti-DNA virus activity of NF-κB pathways. homologs of diedel, which encode a cytokine that inhibits apoptosis and the Imd pathway in Drosophila, are similarly found in ascoviruses, baculoviruses, and entomopoxviruses, likely through independent horizontal transfer from arthropod hosts},

Sequences sharing similarities with host integration motifs (HIMs) of Microplitis demolitor bracovirus (MdBV) circles involved in integration into DNA could be identiﬁed in 12 CcBV circles, which encode PTP and VANK gene families involved in host immune disruption. A PCR approach performed on a subset of these circles indicated that they persisted in parasitized M. sexta hemocytes as linear forms, possibly integrated in host DNA. Furthermore, by using a primer extension capture method based on these HIMs and high-throughput sequencing, we could show that 8 out of 9 circles tested were integrated in M. sexta hemocyte genomic DNA and that integration had occurred speciﬁcally using the HIM, indicating that an HIM-mediated speciﬁc mechanism was involved in their integration. Investigation of BV circle insertion sites at the genome scale revealed that certain genomic regions appeared to be enriched in BV insertions, but no speciﬁc M. sexta target site could be identiﬁed.},

The identification of a specific and efficient integration mechanism shared by several bracovirus species opens the question of its role in braconid parasitoid wasp parasitism success. Indeed, results obtained here show massive integration of bracovirus DNA in somatic immune cells at each parasitism event of a caterpillarhost. Given that bracoviruses do not replicate in infected cells, integration of viral sequences in host DNA might allow the production of PTP and VANK virulence proteins within newly dividing cells of caterpillar hosts that continue to develop during parasitism. Furthermore, this integration process could serve as a basis to understand how PDVs mediate the recently identified gene flux between parasitoid waspsand Lepidoptera and the frequency of these horizontal transfer events in nature.},

	abstract = {Background: Female endoparasitic ichneumonid wasps inject virus-like particles into their caterpillar hosts to suppress immunity. These particles are classified as ichnovirus virions and resemble ascovirus virions, which are also transmitted by parasitic wasps and attack caterpillars. Ascoviruses replicate DNA and produce virions. Polydnavirus DNA consists of wasp DNA replicated by the wasp from its genome, which also directs particle synthesis. Structural similarities between ascovirus and ichnovirus particles and the biology of their transmission suggest that ichnoviruses evolved from ascoviruses, although molecular evidence for this hypothesis is lacking.
Results: Here we show that a family of unique pox-D5 NTPase proteins in the Glypta fumiferanae ichnovirus are related to three Diadromus pulchellus ascovirus proteins encoded by ORFs 90, 91 and 93. A new alignment technique also shows that two proteins from a related ichnovirus are orthologs of other ascovirus virion proteins.
Conclusion: Our results provide molecular evidence supporting the origin of ichnoviruses from ascoviruses by lateral transfer of ascoviral genes into ichneumonid wasp genomes, perhaps the first example of symbiogenesis between large DNA viruses and eukaryotic organisms. We also discuss the limits of this evidence through complementary studies, which revealed that passive lateral transfer of viral genes among polydnaviral, bacterial, and wasp genomes may have occurred repeatedly through an intimate coupling of both recombination and replication of viral genomes during evolution. The impact of passive lateral transfers on evolutionary relationships between polydnaviruses and viruses with large double-stranded genomes is considered in the context of the theory of symbiogenesis.},

A copy of the viral genome is present in wasp chromosomes, thus ensuring vertical transmission. Polydnaviruses comprise two taxa, Bracovirus and Ichnovirus, shown to have distinct viral ancestors whose genomes were “captured” by ancestral wasps. While evidence indicates that bracoviruses derive from a nudivirus ancestor, the identity of the ichnovirus progenitor remains unknown. In addition, ichnoviruses are found in two ichneumonid wasp subfamilies, Campopleginae and Banchinae, where they constitute morphologically and genomically different virus types. To address the question of whether these two ichnovirus subgroups have distinct ancestors, we used genomic, proteomic, and transcriptomic analyses to characterize particle proteins of the banchine Glypta fumiferanae ichnovirus and the genes encoding them. Several proteins were found to be homologous to those identiﬁed earlier for campoplegine ichnoviruses while the corresponding genes were located in clusters of the wasp genome similar to those observed previously in a campoplegine wasp. However, for the ﬁrst time in a polydnavirus system, these clusters also revealed sequences encoding enzymes presumed to form the replicative machinery of the progenitor virus and observed to be overexpressed in the virogenic tissue. Homology searches pointed to nucleocytoplasmic large DNA viruses as the likely source of these genes. These data, along with an analysis of the chromosomal form of ﬁve viral genome segments, provide clear evidence for the relatedness of the banchine and campoplegine ichnovirus ancestors.},

Up to now, all described cases fall into the Ichneumonoidea superfamily, which only represents around 10\% of hymenoptera diversity, raising the question of whether such domestication occurred outside this clade. Furthermore, the biology of the ancestral donor viruses is completely unknown. Since the 1980’s, we know that Drosophila parasitoids belonging to the Leptopilina genus, which diverged from the Ichneumonoidea superfamily 225My ago, do produce immuno-suppressive viruslike structure in their reproductive apparatus. However, the viral origin of these structures has been the subject of debate. In this paper, we provide genomic and experimental evidence that those structures do derive from an ancestral virus endogenization event. Interestingly, its close relatives induce a behaviour manipulation in present-day wasps. Thus, we conclude that virus domestication is more prevalent than previously thought and that behaviour manipulation may have been instrumental in the birth of such associations.},

During oviposition, female wasps introduce venom into the larval hosts’ body cavity. The venom contains discrete, 300 nm-wide, mixed-strategy extracellular vesicles (MSEVs), until recently referred to as virus-like particles. While the crucial immune suppressive functions of L. heterotoma MSEVs have remained undisputed, their biotic nature and origin still remain controversial. In recent proteomics analyses of L. heterotoma MSEVs, we identiﬁed 161 proteins in three classes: conserved eukaryotic proteins, infection and immunity related proteins, and proteins without clear annotation. Here we report 246 additional proteins from the L. heterotoma MSEV proteome. An enrichment analysis of the entire proteome supports vesicular nature of these structures. Sequences for more than 90\% of these proteins are present in the whole-body transcriptome. Sequencing and de novo assembly of the 460 Mb-sized L. heterotoma genome revealed 90\% of MSEV proteins have coding regions within the genomic scaffolds. Altogether, these results explain the stable association of MSEVs with their wasps, and like other wasp structures, their vertical inheritance. While our results do not rule out a viral origin of MSEVs, they suggest that a similar strategy for co-opting cellular machinery for immune suppression may be shared by other wasps to gain advantage over their hosts. These results are relevant to our understanding of the evolution of ﬁgitid and related wasp species.},

Mass rearing of insects, under insect farming conditions or even in industrial settings, can be the key for a change in the way natural resources are utilized in order to produce meat, animal protein and a list of other valuable animal products. However, because insect mass rearing technology is relatively new, little is known about the different factors that determine the quality and yield of the production process. Obtaining such knowledge is crucial for the success of insect-based product development. One of the issues that is likely to compromise the success of insect rearing is the outbreak of insect diseases. In particular, viral diseases can be devastating for the productivity and the quality of mass rearing systems. Prevention and management of viral diseases imply the understanding of the different factors that interact in insect mass rearing. This publication provides an overview of the known viruses in insects most commonly reared for food and feed. Nowadays with large-scale sequencing techniques, new viruses are rapidly being discovered. We discuss factors affecting the emergence of viruses in mass rearing systems, along with virus transmission routes. Finally we provide an overview of the wide range of measures available to prevent and manage virus outbreaks in mass rearing systems, ranging from simple sanitation methods to highly sophisticated methods including RNAi and transgenics.},

Speciﬁcally, the phyletic relationship between two giant dsDNA virus families that are presumed to be close, Mimiviridae, which infect Acanthamoeba, and Phycodnaviridae, which infect algae, is still obscure and needs to be clariﬁed by indepth analysis. Here, we studied Mimiviridae–Phycodnaviridae phylogeny including the newly identiﬁed Heterosigma akashiwo virus strain HaV53. Gene-to-gene comparison of HaV53 with other giant dsDNA viruses showed that only a small proportion of HaV53 genes show similarities with the others, revealing its uniqueness among Phycodnaviridae. Phylogenetic/genomic analysis of Phycodnaviridae including HaV53 revealed that the family can be classiﬁed into four distinctive subfamilies, namely, Megaviridae (Mimivirus-like), Chlorovirus-type, and Coccolitho/Phaeovirus-type groups, and HaV53 independent of the other three groups. Several orthologs found in speciﬁc subfamilies while absent from the others were identiﬁed, providing potential family marker genes. Finally, reconstruction of the evolutionary history of Phycodnaviridae and Mimiviridae revealed that these viruses are descended from a common ancestor with a small set of genes and reached their current diversity by differentially acquiring gene sets during the course of evolution. Our study illustrates the phylogeny and evolution of Mimiviridae–Phycodnaviridae and proposes classiﬁcations that better represent phyletic relationships among the family members.},

	abstract = {Background: Viral DNA-binding proteins have served as good models to study the biochemistry of transcription regulation and chromatin dynamics. Computational analysis of viral DNA-binding regulatory proteins and identification of their previously undetected homologs encoded by cellular genomes might lead to a better understanding of their function and evolution in both viral and cellular systems.
Results: The phyletic range and the conserved DNA-binding domains of the viral regulatory proteins of the poxvirus D6R/N1R and baculoviral Bro protein families have not been previously defined. Using computational analysis, we show that the amino-terminal module of the D6R/N1R proteins defines a novel, conserved DNA-binding domain (the KilA-N domain) that is found in a wide range of proteins of large bacterial and eukaryotic DNA viruses. The KilA-N domain is suggested to be homologous to the fungal DNA-binding APSES domain. We provide evidence for the KilA-N and APSES domains sharing a common fold with the nucleic acid-binding modules of the LAGLIDADG nucleases and the amino-terminal domains of the tRNA endonuclease. The amino-terminal module of the Bro proteins is another, distinct DNA-binding domain (the Bro-N domain) that is present in proteins whose domain architectures parallel those of the KilA-N domain-containing proteins. A detailed analysis of the KilA-N and Bro-N domains and the associated domains points to extensive domain shuffling and lineage-specific gene family expansion within DNA virus genomes.
Conclusions: We define a large class of novel viral DNA-binding proteins and their cellular homologs and identify their domain architectures. On the basis of phyletic pattern analysis we present evidence for a probable viral origin of the fungus-specific cell-cycle regulatory transcription factors containing the APSES DNA-binding domain. We also demonstrate the extensive role of lineage-specific gene expansion and domain shuffling, within a limited set of approximately 24 domains, in the generation of the diversity of virus-specific regulatory proteins.},

              Polydnaviruses form a group of unconventional double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) viruses transmitted by endoparasitic wasps during egg laying into caterpillar hosts, where viral gene expression is essential to immature wasp survival. A copy of the viral genome is present in wasp chromosomes, thus ensuring vertical transmission. Polydnaviruses comprise two taxa,
              Bracovirus
              and
              Ichnovirus
              , shown to have distinct viral ancestors whose genomes were “captured” by ancestral wasps. While evidence indicates that bracoviruses derive from a nudivirus ancestor, the identity of the ichnovirus progenitor remains unknown. In addition, ichnoviruses are found in two ichneumonid wasp subfamilies, Campopleginae and Banchinae, where they constitute morphologically and genomically different virus types. To address the question of whether these two ichnovirus subgroups have distinct ancestors, we used genomic, proteomic, and transcriptomic analyses to characterize particle proteins of the banchine
              Glypta fumiferanae
              ichnovirus and the genes encoding them. Several proteins were found to be homologous to those identified earlier for campoplegine ichnoviruses while the corresponding genes were located in clusters of the wasp genome similar to those observed previously in a campoplegine wasp. However, for the first time in a polydnavirus system, these clusters also revealed sequences encoding enzymes presumed to form the replicative machinery of the progenitor virus and observed to be overexpressed in the virogenic tissue. Homology searches pointed to nucleocytoplasmic large DNA viruses as the likely source of these genes. These data, along with an analysis of the chromosomal form of five viral genome segments, provide clear evidence for the relatedness of the banchine and campoplegine ichnovirus ancestors.
            
            
              IMPORTANCE
              Recent work indicates that the two recognized polydnavirus taxa,
              Bracovirus
              and
              Ichnovirus
              , are derived from distinct viruses whose genomes integrated into the genomes of ancestral wasps. However, the identity of the ichnovirus ancestor is unknown, and questions remain regarding the possibility that the two described ichnovirus subgroups, banchine and campoplegine ichnoviruses, have distinct origins. Our study provides unequivocal evidence that these two ichnovirus types are derived from related viral progenitors. This suggests that morphological and genomic differences observed between the ichnovirus lineages, including features unique to banchine ichnovirus genome segments, result from evolutionary divergence either before or after their endogenization. Strikingly, analysis of selected wasp genomic regions revealed genes presumed to be part of the replicative machinery of the progenitor virus, shedding new light on the likely identity of this virus. Finally, these genes could well play a role in ichnovirus replication as they were overexpressed in the virogenic tissue.},

The endogenization of nudiviruses has been reported in several insects, leading to the question of whether genomic integration is a common phenomenon for these viruses. In this study, genomic assemblies of insects and other arthropods were analyzed to identify endogenous sequences related to Nudiviridae. A total of 359 nudivirus-like genes were identiﬁed in 43 species belonging to different groups; however, none of these genes were detected in the known hosts of nudiviruses. A large proportion of the putative EVEs identiﬁed in this study encode intact open reading frames or are transcribed as mRNAs, suggesting that they result from recent endogenization of nudiviruses. Phylogenetic analyses of the identiﬁed EVEs and inspections of their ﬂanking regions indicated that integration of nudiviruses has occurred recurrently during the evolution of arthropods. This is the ﬁrst report of a comprehensive screening for nudivirus-derived EVEs in arthropod genomes. The results of this study demonstrated that a large variety of arthropods, especially hemipteran and hymenopteran insects, have previously been or are still infected by nudiviruses. These ﬁndings have greatly extended the host range of Nudiviridae and provide new insights into viral diversity, evolution, and host–virus interactions.},

	abstract = {Abstract
          
            Polydnaviruses (PDVs) are mutualistic endogenous viruses associated with some lineages of parasitoid wasps that allow successful development of the wasps within their hosts. PDVs include two taxa resulting from independent virus acquisitions in braconid (bracoviruses) and ichneumonid wasps (ichnoviruses). PDV genomes are fully incorporated into the wasp genomes and comprise (1) virulence genes located on proviral segments that are packaged into the viral particle, and (2) genes involved in the production of the viral particles, which are not encapsidated. Whereas the genomic organization of bracoviruses within the wasp genome is relatively well known, the architecture of endogenous ichnoviruses remains poorly understood. We sequenced the genome of two ichnovirus-carrying wasp species,
            Hyposoter didymator
            and
            Campoletis sonorensis
            . Complete assemblies with long scaffold sizes allowed identification of the integrated ichnovirus, highlighting an extreme dispersion within the wasp genomes of the viral loci,
            i.e.
            isolated proviral segments and clusters of replication genes. Comparing the two wasp species, proviral segments harbor distinct gene content and variable genomic environment, whereas viral machinery clusters show conserved gene content and order, and can be inserted in collinear wasp genomic regions. This distinct architecture is consistent with the biological properties of the two viral elements: proviral segments producing virulence proteins allowing parasitism success are fine-tuned to the host physiology, while an ancestral viral architecture was likely maintained for the genes involved in virus particle production. Finding a distinct genomic architecture of ichnoviruses and bracoviruses highlights different evolutionary trajectories leading to virus domestication in the two wasp lineages.},

Using RNA-Seq data and manual annotation of genes of viral origin, we produced a high-quality gene set that includes 18,586 eukaryotic and 171 virus-derived protein-coding genes. Bracoviruses are dsDNA viruses with unusual genome architecture, in which the viral genome is integrated into the wasp genome and is comprised of two distinct components: proviral segments that are ampliﬁed, circularized, and packaged into virions for export into the wasp’s host via oviposition; and replication genes. This genome assembly revealed that at least two scaffolds contain both nudivirus-like genes and proviral segments, demonstrating that at least some of these components are near each other in the genome on a single chromosome. The updated assembly and annotation are available in several publicly accessible databases; including the National Center for Biotechnology Information and the Ag Data Commons. In addition, all raw sequence data available for M. demolitor have been consolidated and are available for visualization at the i5k Workspace.

PDVs associated with braconid and ichneumonid wasps, bracoviruses and ichnoviruses respectively, both deliver multiple circular dsDNA molecules to the caterpillar. These molecules contain virulence genes but lack core genes typically involved in particle production. This is not completely unexpected given that no PDV replication takes place in the caterpillar. Particle production is confined to the wasp ovary where viral DNAs are generated from proviral copies maintained within the wasp genome. We recently showed that the genes involved in bracovirus particle production reside within the wasp genome and are related to nudiviruses. In the present work we characterized genes involved in ichnovirus particle production by analyzing the components of purified Hyposoter didymator Ichnovirus particles by LC-MS/MS and studying their organization in the wasp genome. Their products are conserved among ichnovirus-associated wasps and constitute a specific set of proteins in the virosphere. Strikingly, these genes are clustered in specialized regions of the wasp genome which are amplified along with proviral DNA during virus particle replication, but are not packaged in the particles. Clearly our results show that ichnoviruses and bracoviruses particles originated from different viral entities, thus providing an example of convergent evolution where two groups of wasps have independently domesticated viruses to deliver genes into their hosts.},

	abstract = {The origin of plant parasitism within the phylum Nematoda is intriguing. The ability to parasitize plants has originated independently at least three times during nematode evolution and, as more molecular data has emerged, it has become clear that multiple instances of horizontal gene transfer (HGT) from bacteria and fungi have played a crucial role in the nematode's adaptation to this new lifestyle. The first reported HGT cases in plant-parasitic nematodes were genes encoding plant cell wall–degrading enzymes. Other putative examples of HGT were subsequently described, including genes that may be involved in the modulation of the plant's defense system, the establishment of a nematode feeding site, and the synthesis or processing of nutrients. Although, in many cases, it is difficult to pinpoint the donor organism, candidate donors are usually soil dwelling and are either plant-pathogenic or plant-associated microorganisms, hence occupying the same ecological niche as the nematodes. The exact mechanisms of transfer are unknown, although close contacts with donor microorganisms, such as symbiotic or trophic interactions, are a possibility. The widespread occurrence of horizontally transferred genes in evolutionarily independent plant-parasitic nematode lineages suggests that HGT may be a prerequisite for successful plant parasitism in nematodes.},

A copy of the viral genome is present in wasp chromosomes, thus ensuring vertical transmission. Polydnaviruses comprise two taxa, Bracovirus and Ichnovirus, shown to have distinct viral ancestors whose genomes were “captured” by ancestral wasps. While evidence indicates that bracoviruses derive from a nudivirus ancestor, the identity of the ichnovirus progenitor remains unknown. In addition, ichnoviruses are found in two ichneumonid wasp subfamilies, Campopleginae and Banchinae, where they constitute morphologically and genomically different virus types. To address the question of whether these two ichnovirus subgroups have distinct ancestors, we used genomic, proteomic, and transcriptomic analyses to characterize particle proteins of the banchine Glypta fumiferanae ichnovirus and the genes encoding them. Several proteins were found to be homologous to those identiﬁed earlier for campoplegine ichnoviruses while the corresponding genes were located in clusters of the wasp genome similar to those observed previously in a campoplegine wasp. However, for the ﬁrst time in a polydnavirus system, these clusters also revealed sequences encoding enzymes presumed to form the replicative machinery of the progenitor virus and observed to be overexpressed in the virogenic tissue. Homology searches pointed to nucleocytoplasmic large DNA viruses as the likely source of these genes. These data, along with an analysis of the chromosomal form of ﬁve viral genome segments, provide clear evidence for the relatedness of the banchine and campoplegine ichnovirus ancestors.},

	abstract = {The wide spread of gene exchange and loss in the prokaryotic world has prompted the concept of ‘lateral genomics’ to the point of an outright denial of the relevance of phylogenetic trees for evolution. However, the pronounced coherence congruence of the topologies of numerous gene trees, particularly those for (nearly) universal genes, translates into the notion of a statistical tree of life (STOL), which reflects a central trend of vertical evolution. The STOL can be employed as a framework for reconstruction of the evolutionary processes in the prokaryotic world. Quantitatively, however, horizontal gene transfer (HGT) dominates microbial evolution, with the rate of gene gain and loss being comparable to the rate of point mutations and much greater than the duplication rate. Theoretical models of evolution suggest that HGT is essential for the survival of microbial populations that otherwise deteriorate due to the Muller’s ratchet effect. Apparently, at least some bacteria and archaea evolved dedicated vehicles for gene transfer that evolved from selfish elements such as plasmids and viruses. Recent phylogenomic analyses suggest that episodes of massive HGT were pivotal for the emergence of major groups of organisms such as multiple archaeal phyla as well as eukaryotes. Similar analyses appear to indicate that, in addition to donating hundreds of genes to the emerging eukaryotic lineage, mitochondrial endosymbiosis severely curtailed HGT. These results shed new light on the routes of evolutionary transitions, but caution is due given the inherent uncertainty of deep phylogenies.},

	abstract = {Background: Published accounts of horizontally acquired genes in plant-parasitic nematodes have not been the result of a specific search for gene transfer per se, but rather have emerged from characterization of individual genes. We present a method for a high-throughput genome screen for horizontally acquired genes, illustrated using expressed sequence tag (EST) data from three species of root-knot nematode, Meloidogyne species.
Results: Our approach identified the previously postulated horizontally transferred genes and revealed six new candidates. Screening was partially dependent on sequence quality, with more candidates identified from clustered sequences than from raw EST data. Computational and experimental methods verified the horizontal gene transfer candidates as bona fide nematode genes. Phylogenetic analysis implicated rhizobial ancestors as donors of horizontally acquired genes in Meloidogyne.
Conclusions: High-throughput genomic screening is an effective way to identify horizontal gene transfer candidates. Transferred genes that have undergone amelioration of nucleotide composition and codon bias have been identified using this approach. Analysis of these horizontally transferred gene candidates suggests a link between horizontally transferred genes in Meloidogyne and parasitism.},

More than 4000 ESTs were sequenced from representatives of the two major groups of rumen Cilates: the order Entodiniomorphida (Entodinium simplex, Entodinium caudatum, Eudiplodinium maggii, Metadinium medium, Diploplastron affine, Polyplastron multivesiculatum and Epidinium ecaudatum) and the order Vestibuliferida, previously called Holotricha (Isotricha prostoma, Isotricha intestinalis and Dasytricha ruminantium).
Results: A comparison of the sequences with the completely sequenced genomes of Eukaryotes and Prokaryotes, followed by large-scale construction and analysis of phylogenies, identified 148 ciliate genes that specifically cluster with genes from the Bacteria and Archaea. The phylogenetic clustering with bacterial genes, coupled with the absence of close relatives of these genes in the Ciliate Tetrahymena thermophila, indicates that they have been acquired via Horizontal Gene Transfer (HGT) after the colonization of the gut by the rumen Ciliates.
Conclusion: Among the HGT candidates, we found an over-representation ({\textgreater}75\%) of genes involved in metabolism, specifically in the catabolism of complex carbohydrates, a rich food source},

              Mabuya

Its cognate receptor, required for its fusogenic activity, was searched for by a screening assay using the GeneBridge4 human/Chinese hamster radiation hybrid panel and found to be the MPZL1 gene, previously identified in mammals as a signal-transducing transmembrane protein involved in cell migration. Together, these results show that syncytin capture is not restricted to placental mammals, but can also take place in the rare nonmammalian vertebrates in which a viviparous placentotrophic mode of reproduction emerged. It suggests that similar molecular tools have been used for the convergent evolution of placentation in independently evolved and highly distant vertebrates.},

	abstract = {The innate immune system of insects is divided into humoral and cellular defense responses. Humoral defenses include antimicrobial peptides, the cascades that regulate coagulation and melanization of hemolymph, and the production of reactive intermediates of oxygen and nitrogen. Cellular defenses refer to hemocyte-mediated responses like phagocytosis and encapsulation. In this review, we discuss the cellular immune responses of insects with emphasis on studies in Lepidoptera and Diptera. Insect hemocytes originate from mesodermally derived stem cells that differentiate into speciﬁc lineages identiﬁed by morphology, function, and molecular markers. In Lepidoptera, most cellular defense responses involve granular cells and plasmatocytes, whereas in Drosophila they involve primarily plasmatocytes and lamellocytes. Insect hemocytes recognize a variety of foreign targets as well as alterations to self. Both humoral and cell surface receptors are involved in these recognition events. Once a target is recognized as foreign, hemocyte-mediated defense responses are regulated by signaling factors and effector molecules that control cell adhesion and cytotoxicity. Several lines of evidence indicate that humoral and cellular defense responses are well-coordinated with one another. Cross-talk between the immune and nervous system may also play a role in regulating inﬂammation-like responses in insects during infection.  2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Endoparasitoids introduce a variety of factors into their host during oviposition to ensure successful parasitism. These include ovarian and venom ﬂuids that may be accompanied by viruses and virus-like particles. An overwhelming number of venom components are enzymes with similarities to insect metabolic enzymes, suggesting their recruitment for expression in venom glands with modiﬁed functions. Other components include protease inhibitors, paralytic factors, and constituents that facilitate/enhance entry and expression of genes from symbiotic viruses or virus-like particles. In addition, the venom gland may itself support replication/production of some viruses or virus-like entities. Overlapping functions and structural similarities of some venom, ovarian, and virus-encoded proteins suggest coevolution of molecules recruited by endoparasitoids to maintain their ﬁtness relative to their host.},

	abstract = {Several lineages of endoparasitoid wasps, which develop inside the body of other insects, have domesticated viruses, used as delivery tools of essential virulence factors for the successful development of their progeny. Virus domestications are major evolutionary transitions in highly diverse parasitoid wasps. Much progress has recently been made to characterize the nature of these ancestrally captured endogenous viruses that have evolved within the wasp genomes. Virus domestication from diﬀerent viral families occurred at least three times in parasitoid wasps. This evolutionary convergence led to diﬀerent strategies. Polydnaviruses (PDVs) are viral gene transfer agents and virus-like particles of the wasp Venturia canescens deliver proteins. Here, we take the standpoint of parasitoid wasps to review current knowledge on virus domestications by diﬀerent parasitoid lineages. Then, based on genomic data from parasitoid wasps, PDVs and exogenous viruses, we discuss the diﬀerent evolutionary steps required to transform viruses into vehicles for the delivery of the virulence molecules that we observe today. Finally, we discuss how endoparasitoid wasps manipulate host physiology and ensure parasitism success, to highlight the possible advantages of viral domestication as compared with other virulence strategies.},

              Viruses in the family
              Polydnaviridae
              are symbiotically associated with parasitoid wasps. Wasps inject polydnaviruses (PDVs) when laying an egg into their insect host, and expression of viral gene products causes several physiological alterations, including immunosuppression, that allow the wasp's progeny to develop. As with other PDVs, most
              Microplitis demolitor
              bracovirus (MdBV) genes are related variants that form gene families. The largest MdBV gene family includes 13 members that encode predicted proteins related to protein tyrosine phosphatases (PTPs). Sequence analysis during the present study indicated that five PTP family members (PTP-H2, -H3, -N1, and -N2) have fully conserved catalytic domains, whereas other family members exhibited replacements, deletions, or rearrangements of amino acids considered essential for tyrosine phosphatase activity. Expression studies indicated that most MdBV PTP genes are expressed in virus-infected host insects, with transcript abundance usually being highest in hemocytes. MdBV-infected hemocytes also exhibited higher levels of tyrosine phosphatase activity than noninfected hemocytes. We produced expression constructs for four of the most abundantly expressed PTP family members and conducted functional studies with hemocyte-like
              Drosophila
              S2 cells. These experiments suggested that recombinant PTP-H2 and PTP-H3 are functional tyrosine phosphatases whereas PTP-H1 and PTP-J1 are not. PTP-H2 and -H3 localized to focal adhesions in S2 cells, and coexpression with another MdBV gene product, Glc1.8, resulted in complete inhibition of phagocytosis.},

We ﬁnd these changes earlier, seen here in the early Eocene Okanagan Highlands fossil deposits of western North America. Some of these may have occurred even earlier, but have been obscured by taphonomic processes. We provide an overview of the Okanagan Highlands Hymenoptera to family level and in some cases below that, with a minimum of 25 named families and at least 30 when those tentatively assigned or distinct at family level, but not named are included. Some are poorly known as fossils (Trigonalidae, Siricidae, Peradeniidae, Monomachidae), and some represent the oldest conﬁrmed occurrences (Trigonalidae, Pompilidae, Sphecidae sensu stricto, Peradeniidae, Monomachidae, and possibly Halictidae). Some taxa previously thought to be relictual or extinct by the end of the Cretaceous (Angarosphecidae, Archaeoscoliinae, some Diapriidae) are present and sometimes abundant in the early Eocene. Living relatives of some taxa are now present in different climate regimes or on different continents.},

Bracoviruses are thought to originate from a single integration of an ancestral nudivirus into the ancestor of microgastroid complex {\textasciitilde}100 million years ago. However, all the known nudiviruses are only distantly related to bracoviruses, and much remains obscure about the origin of bracoviruses. Here we employ a paleovirological method to screen endogenous nudivirus-like elements across arthropods. Interestingly, we identify many endogenous nudivirus-like elements within the genome of Eurytoma brunniventris, a species of the Chalcidoidea superfamily. Among them, we ﬁnd 14 core gene sequences are likely to be derived from a betanudivirus (designated EbrENV-β), suggesting that betanudivirus has been circulating in parasitoid wasps. Phylogenomic analysis suggests that EbrENV-β is the known closest relative of bracoviruses. Synteny analyses show the order of core genes is not well conserved between EbrENV-β and nudiviruses, revealing the dynamic nature of the evolution of nudivirus genome structures. Our ﬁndings narrow down the evolutionary gap between bracoviruses and nudiviruses and provide novel insights into the origin and evolution of polydnaviruses.},

However, the assembly tools usually generate a large amount of contigs containing many misassemblies, which are caused by problems of repetitive regions, chimeric reads and sequencing errors. As they can improve the accuracy of assembly results, detecting and correcting the misassemblies in contigs are appealing, yet challenging. In this study, a novel method, called MEC, is proposed to identify and correct misassemblies in contigs. Based on the insert size distribution of paired-end reads and the statistical analysis of GC-contents, MEC can identify more misassemblies accurately. We evaluate our MEC with the metrics (NA50, NGA50) on four datasets, compared it with the most available misassembly correction tools, and carry out experiments to analyze the inﬂuence of MEC on scaffolding results, which shows that MEC can reduce misassemblies effectively and result in quantitative improvements in scaffolding quality.

            (in Braconidae) and
            Ichnovirus
            (in Ichneumonidae). These viruses are produced using genes known collectively as endogenous viral elements (EVEs) that represent historical, now heritable viral integration events in wasp genomes. Here, new genome sequence assemblies for eleven species and six publicly available genomes from the Ichneumonoidea were screened with the goal of identifying novel EVEs and characterizing the breadth of species in lineages with known EVEs. Exhaustive similarity searches combined with the identification of ancient core genes revealed sequences from both known and novel EVEs. Two species harbored novel, independently derived EVEs related to a divergent large double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) virus that manipulates behavior in other hymenopteran species. While bracovirus or ichnovirus EVEs were identified as expected in three species, the absence of ichnoviruses in several species suggests that they are independently derived and present in two younger, less widespread lineages than previously thought. Overall, this study presents a novel bioinformatic approach for EVE discovery in genomes and shows that three divergent virus families (nudiviruses, the ancestors of ichnoviruses, and LbFV-like viruses) are recurrently acquired as EVEs in parasitoid wasps. Virus acquisition in the parasitoid wasps is a common process that has occurred in many more than two lineages from a diverse range of arthropod-infecting dsDNA viruses.
          
          
            Significance
            Parasitoid wasps are an extremely diverse group of animals that are known to harbor Endogenous Virus Elements (EVEs) that produce virions or virus-like particles of key importance in wasps’ parasitism success. However, the prevalence and diversity of independently acquired EVEs in parasitoid wasp lineages has remained largely uncharacterized on a widespread scale. This study represents an important first step and hints at the massive, untapped diversity of EVEs in parasitoid wasps via the identification of several novel virus co-option events from diverse groups of double-stranded DNA virus pathogens.},

              For insects known as parasitoid wasps, successful development as a parasite results in the death of the host insect. As a result of this lethal interaction, wasps and their hosts have coevolved strategies to gain an advantage in this evolutionary arms race. Although normally considered to be strict pathogens, some viruses have established persistent infections within parasitoid wasp lineages and are beneficial to wasps during parasitism. Heritable associations between viruses and parasitoid wasps have evolved independently multiple times, but most of these systems remain largely understudied with respect to viral origin, transmission and replication strategies of the virus, and interactions between the virus and host insects. Here, we report a detailed characterization of Diachasmimorpha longicaudata entomopoxvirus (DlEPV), a poxvirus found within the venom gland of
              Diachasmimorpha longicaudata
              wasps. Our results show that DlEPV exhibits similar but distinct transmission and replication dynamics compared to those of other parasitoid viral elements, including vertical transmission of the virus within wasps, as well as virus replication in both female wasps and fruit fly hosts. Functional assays demonstrate that DlEPV is highly virulent within fly hosts, and wasps without DlEPV have severely reduced parasitism success compared to those with a typical viral load. Taken together, the data presented in this study illustrate a novel case of beneficial virus evolution, in which a virus of unique origin has undergone convergent evolution with other viral elements associated with parasitoid wasps to provide an analogous function throughout parasitism.
            
            
              IMPORTANCE
              Viruses are generally considered to be disease-causing agents, but several instances of beneficial viral elements have been identified in insects called parasitoid wasps. These virus-derived entities are passed on through wasp generations and enhance the success of the wasps’ parasitic life cycle. Many parasitoid-virus partnerships studied to date exhibit common features among independent cases of this phenomenon, including a mother-to-offspring route of virus transmission, a restricted time and location for virus replication, and a positive effect of virus activity on wasp survival. Our characterization of Diachasmimorpha longicaudata entomopoxvirus (DlEPV), a poxvirus found in
              Diachasmimorpha longicaudata
              parasitoid wasps, represents a novel example of beneficial virus evolution. Here, we show that DlEPV exhibits functional similarities to known parasitoid viral elements that support its comparable role during parasitism. Our results also demonstrate unique differences that suggest DlEPV is more autonomous than other long-term viral associations described in parasitoid wasps.},

Insect TE landscapes are highly variable both within and across insect orders, although phylogenetic relatedness appears to correlate with similarity in insect TE content. This correlation is unlikely to be solely due to inheritance of TEs from shared ancestors and may partly reflect preferential horizontal transfer of TEs between closely related species. The influence of insect traits on TE landscapes, however, remains unclear. Recent findings indicate that, in addition to being involved in insect adaptations and aging, TEs are seemingly at the cornerstone of insect antiviral immunity. Thus, TEs are emerging as essential insect symbionts that may have deleterious or beneficial consequences on their hosts, depending on context.},

Using a comprehensive bioinformatic pipeline, we screened all nineteen published ant genomes for EVEs. Once the EVEs were identiﬁed, we assessed their phylogenetic relationships to other closely related exogenous viruses. A diverse group of EVEs were discovered in all screened ant host genomes and in many cases are similar to previously identiﬁed exogenous viruses. EVEs similar to ssRNA viral proteins are the most common viral lineage throughout the ant hosts, which is potentially due to more chronic infection or more effective endogenization of certain ssRNA viruses in ants. In addition, both EVEs similar to viral glycoproteins and retrovirus-derived proteins are also abundant throughout ant genomes, suggesting their tendency to endogenize. Several of these newly discovered EVEs are found to be potentially functional within the genome. The discovery and analysis of EVEs is essential in beginning to understand viral–ant interactions over evolutionary time.},

            The Ichneumonoidea (Ichneumonidae and Braconidae) is an incredibly diverse superfamily of parasitoid wasps that includes species that produce virus-like entities in their reproductive tracts to promote successful parasitism of host insects.

On occasion, hosts recruited retroviral genes to mediate their own biological functions, a process formally known as co-option or exaptation. Much remains unknown about the extent of retroviral gene co-option in vertebrates, although more than ten retroviral gene co-option events have been documented. Here, we use a phylogenomic approach to analyze more than 700 vertebrate genomes to uncover retroviral gene co-option taking place during the evolution of vertebrates. We identify a total of 177 independent retroviral gene co-option events in vertebrates, a majority of which have not been reported previously. Among these retroviral gene co-option events, 93 and 84 involve gag and env genes, respectively. More than 78.0\% (138 out of 177) of retroviral gene co-option occurred within mammals. The gag and env co-option events share a generally similar temporal pattern with less frequent retroviral gene co-option identified in the deep branches, suggesting that retroviral gene co-option might have not been maintained for very long time periods. Moreover, we find co-opted retroviral genes are subject to different selection pressure, implying potentially diverse cellular functionality. Our study provides a comprehensive picture of coopted retroviral genes during the evolution of vertebrates, and has implications in understanding the ancient evolution of vertebrate-retrovirus interaction.},

	abstract = {Increasing data indicate that insects serve as major reservoirs and vectors of viruses, which account for the continuously increasing ecological burden and infectious disease outbreaks. Uncovering the hidden diversity of viruses in insects will further the understanding of the ecological and evolutionary perspectives in the emergence of insect-associated virus diseases. In this study, we queried transcriptome sequencing (RNA-Seq) data from more than 600 species across 32 insect orders dwelling in different ecological habitats and recovered more than 1,213 RNA viruses that were recapitulated in 40 families, 2 unclassiﬁed genera, and many unspeciﬁed viral groups. These novel viruses included the well-known insectassociated viruses within Flaviviridae, Picornavirales, Bunyavirales, Mononegavirales, Nidovirales, Reoviridae, and Negevirus. More appeared to form novel clusters within previously described taxa or could be resolved as paraphyletic, including the ﬁrst astrovirus identiﬁed in insects, in which many were sufﬁciently divergent to warrant the establishment of new virus genera or families. Additionally, some viruses were closely related to the recognized plant-, fungus-, and vertebratespeciﬁc species, implying the importance of relationships between insect behavior and virus spread. Comparative genome analyses also revealed high genomic variability with respect to the ﬂexible gene pool and genome architecture of these newly described viruses, including the evidence for genome reshufﬂing ﬁrst discovered in Dicistroviridae. The data reﬂecting the genetically and ecologically diverse viral populations in insects greatly expand our understanding of RNA viruses in nature and highlight that the biodiversity of RNA viruses remains largely unexplored.},

With the widespread utilization of molecular technologies such as next-generation sequencing and the advancement of bioinformatics tools, a new age of viral discovery has commenced. Many of the novel agents being discovered in recent years have been isolated from mosquitoes and exhibit a highly restricted host range. Strikingly, these insectspecific viruses have been found to be members of viral families traditionally associated with human arboviral pathogens, including but not limited to the families Flaviviridae, Togaviridae, Reoviridae, and Bunyaviridae. These agents therefore present novel opportunities in the fields of viral evolution and viral/vector interaction and have tremendous potential as agents for biocontrol of vectors and or viruses of medical importance.},

	abstract = {The Ichneumonoidea (Ichneumonidae and Braconidae) is an incredibly diverse superfamily of parasitoid wasps that includes species that produce virus-like entities in their reproductive tracts to promote successful parasitism of host insects. Research on these entities has traditionally focused upon two viral genera Bracovirus (in Braconidae) and Ichnovirus (in Ichneumonidae). These viruses are produced using genes known collectively as endogenous viral elements (EVEs) that represent historical, now heritable viral integration events in wasp genomes. Here, new genome sequence assemblies for 11 species and 6 publicly available genomes from the Ichneumonoidea were screened with the goal of identifying novel EVEs and characterizing the breadth of species in lineages with known EVEs. Exhaustive similarity searches combined with the identiﬁcation of ancient core genes revealed sequences from both known and novel EVEs. One species harbored a novel, independently derived EVE related to a divergent large double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) virus that manipulates behavior in other hymenopteran species. Although bracovirus or ichnovirus EVEs were identiﬁed as expected in three species, the absence of ichnoviruses in several species suggests that they are independently derived and present in two younger, less widespread lineages than previously thought. Overall, this study presents a novel bioinformatic approach for EVE discovery in genomes and shows that three divergent virus families (nudiviruses, the ancestors of ichnoviruses, and Leptopilina boulardi Filamentous Virus-like viruses) are recurrently acquired as EVEs in parasitoid wasps. Virus acquisition in the parasitoid wasps is a common process that has occurred in many more than two lineages from a diverse range of arthropod-infecting dsDNA viruses. Key words: Ichneumonoidea, virus, endogenous virus element (EVE), polydnaviruses (PDVs), parasitoid wasp genomes.},

              Many ichneumonid and braconid endoparasitoids inject a polydnavirus (PDV) into their caterpillar hosts during oviposition. The viral entities carried by wasps of these families are referred to as “ichnoviruses” (IVs) and “bracoviruses” (BVs), respectively. All IV genomes characterized to date are found in wasps of the subfamily Campopleginae; consequently, little is known about PDVs found in wasps of the subfamily Banchinae, the only other ichneumonid taxon thus far shown to carry these viruses. Here we report on the genome sequence and virion morphology of a PDV carried by the banchine parasitoid
              Glypta fumiferanae
              . With an aggregate genome size of ∼290 kb and 105 genome segments, this virus displays a degree of genome segmentation far greater than that reported for BVs or IVs. The size range of its genome segments is also lower than those in the latter two groups. As reported for other PDVs, the predicted open reading frames of this virus cluster into gene families, including the protein tyrosine phosphatase (PTP) and viral ankyrin (
              ank
              ) families, but phylogenetic analysis indicates that
              ank
              genes of the
              G. fumiferanae
              virus are not embedded within the IV lineage, while its PTPs and those of BVs form distinct clusters. The banchine PDV genome also encodes a novel family of NTPase-like proteins displaying a pox-D5 domain. The unique genomic features of the first banchine virus examined, along with the morphological singularities of its virions (IV-like nucleocapsids, but enveloped in groups like some of the BVs), suggest that they could have an origin distinct from those of IVs and BVs.},

            The Pfam database is a widely used resource for classifying protein sequences into families and domains. Since Pfam was last described in this journal, over 350 new families have been added in Pfam 33.1 and numerous improvements have been made to existing entries. To facilitate research on COVID-19, we have revised the Pfam entries that cover the SARS-CoV-2 proteome, and built new entries for regions that were not covered by Pfam. We have reintroduced Pfam-B which provides an automatically generated supplement to Pfam and contains 136 730 novel clusters of sequences that are not yet matched by a Pfam family. The new Pfam-B is based on a clustering by the MMseqs2 software. We have compared all of the regions in the RepeatsDB to those in Pfam and have started to use the results to build and refine Pfam repeat families. Pfam is freely available for browsing and download at http://pfam.xfam.org/.},

In a five-day meeting in Basel (Switzerland) in June 2019, 22 researchers from 14 countries met to discuss the most important issues in ichneumonid research, including increasing the speed of species discovery, resolving higher-level relationships, and studying the radiation of these parasitoids onto various host groups through time. All agreed that it is time to advertise ichneumonid research more broadly in the scientific community and thereby attract young talents to this group for which specialists are sorely lacking. In order to popularize the group, we here suggest a new name for the family, “Darwin wasps”, to reflect the pivotal role they played in convincing Charles Darwin that not all of creation could have been created by a benevolent god. We hope that the name catches on, and that Darwin wasps start buzzing more loudly across all disciplines of biology.},

Despite their small size, they are familiar to agriculturalists and ﬁeld ecologists alike as one of the principal groups of natural enemies of caterpillars feeding on plants. Their abundance and nearly ubiquitous terrestrial distribution, their intricate interactions with host insects, and their historical association with mutualistic polydnaviruses have all contributed to Microgastrinae becoming a key group of organisms for studying parasitism, parasitoid genomics, and mating biology. However, these rich sources of data have not yet led to a robust genus-level classiﬁcation of the group, and some taxonomic confusion persists as a result. We present the current status of understanding of the general biology, taxonomic history, diversity, geographical patterns, host relationships, and phylogeny of Microgastrinae as a stimulus and foundation for further study. Current progress in elucidating the biology and taxonomy of this important group is rapid and promises a revolution in the classiﬁcation of these wasps in the near future.},

Its parasitic success relies on vesicles (named M. pulchricornis Virus-Like Particles or MpVLPs) that are synthesized in the venom gland and injected into the parasitoid host along with the venom during oviposition. In order to define the content and understand the biogenesis of these atypical vesicles, we performed a transcriptome analysis of the venom gland and a proteomic analysis of the venom and purified MpVLPs. About half of the MpVLPs and soluble venom proteins identified were unknown and no similarity with any known viral sequence was found. However, MpVLPs contained a large number of proteins labelled as metalloproteinases while the most abundant protein family in the soluble venom was that of proteins containing the Domain of Unknown Function DUF-4803. The high number of these proteins identified suggests that a large expansion of these two protein families occurred in M. pulchricornis. Therefore, although the exact mechanism of MpVLPs formation remains to be elucidated, these vesicles appear to be “metalloproteinase bombs” that may have several physiological roles in the host including modifying the functions of its immune cells. The role of DUF4803 proteins, also present in the venom of other braconids, remains to be clarified.},

As parasitoids, they are important natural enemies in most terrestrial ecological communities, particularly as natural enemies of larval Lepidoptera. Despite their diversity and ecological impact, relatively little is known about the evolution and ecology of tachinids, and what is known tends to be widely dispersed in specialized reports, journals, or texts. In this review we synthesize information on the evolutionary history, behavior, and ecology of tachinids and discuss promising directions for future research involving tachinids. We provide an overview of the phylogenetic history and geographic diversity of tachinids, examine the evolution of oviposition strategies and host associations, review known mechanisms of host location, and discuss recent studies dealing with the ecological interactions between tachinids and their hosts. In doing so, we highlight ways in which investigation of these parasitoids provides insight into such topics as biogeographic patterns of diversity, the evolution of ecological specialization, the tritrophic context of enemy-herbivore interactions, and the role of host location behavior in shaping host range.},

              Background
              Parasitoidism, a specialized life strategy in which a parasite eventually kills its host, is frequently found within the insect order Hymenoptera (wasps, ants and bees). A parasitoid lifestyle is one of two dominant life strategies within the hymenopteran superfamily Cynipoidea, with the other being an unusual plant-feeding behavior known as galling. Less commonly, cynipoid wasps exhibit inquilinism, a strategy where some species have adapted to usurp other species’ galls instead of inducing their own. Using a phylogenomic data set of ultraconserved elements from nearly all lineages of Cynipoidea, we here generate a robust phylogenetic framework and timescale to understand cynipoid systematics and the evolution of these life histories.
            
            
              Results
              Our reconstructed evolutionary history for Cynipoidea differs considerably from previous hypotheses. Rooting our analyses with non-cynipoid outgroups, the Paraulacini, a group of inquilines, emerged as sister-group to the rest of Cynipoidea, rendering the gall wasp family Cynipidae paraphyletic. The families Ibaliidae and Liopteridae, long considered archaic and early-branching parasitoid lineages, were found nested well within the Cynipoidea as sister-group to the parasitoid Figitidae. Cynipoidea originated in the early Jurassic around 190 Ma. Either inquilinism or parasitoidism is suggested as the ancestral and dominant strategy throughout the early evolution of cynipoids, depending on whether a simple (three states: parasitoidism, inquilinism and galling) or more complex (seven states: parasitoidism, inquilinism and galling split by host use) model is employed.
            
            
              Conclusions
              Our study has significant impact on understanding cynipoid evolution and highlights the importance of adequate outgroup sampling. We discuss the evolutionary timescale of the superfamily in relation to their insect hosts and host plants, and outline how phytophagous galling behavior may have evolved from entomophagous, parasitoid cynipoids. Our study has established the framework for further physiological and comparative genomic work between gall-making, inquiline and parasitoid lineages, which could also have significant implications for the evolution of diverse life histories in other Hymenoptera.},

            Several malignant tumor cells become apoptotic and revert to the benign phenotype upon parvovirus infection. Recently, we demonstrated that the rat parvovirus RPV/UT also induces apoptosis in the rat thymic lymphoma cell line C58(NT)D. However, a minority of cells that escaped apoptosis showed properties different from the parental cells, such as resistance to apoptosis, enhanced cell adherence, and suppressed tumorigenicity. The present study was performed to determine the molecular mechanism of parvovirus-induced phenotypic modification, including oncosuppression. We demonstrated that the nonstructural (NS) proteins of RPV/UT induced apoptosis in C58(NT)D cells and suppressed tumor growth in vivo. Interestingly, NS proteins induced the expression of ciliary neurotrophic factor receptor alpha, which is up-regulated in revertant cell clones, and enhanced histone acetylation of its gene. These results indicate that parvoviral NS regulate host gene expression through histone acetylation, suggesting a possible mechanism of oncosuppression.},

            Human herpesvirus 6A and 6B (HHV-6) can integrate into the germline, and as a result, ∼70 million people harbor the genome of one of these viruses in every cell of their body. Until now, it has been largely unknown if 1) these integrations are ancient, 2) if they still occur, and 3) whether circulating virus strains differ from integrated ones. Here, we used next-generation sequencing and mining of public human genome data sets to generate the largest and most diverse collection of circulating and integrated HHV-6 genomes studied to date. In genomes of geographically dispersed, only distantly related people, we identified clades of integrated viruses that originated from a single ancestral event, confirming this with fluorescent in situ hybridization to directly observe the integration locus. In contrast to HHV-6B, circulating and integrated HHV-6A sequences form distinct clades, arguing against ongoing integration of circulating HHV-6A or “reactivation” of integrated HHV-6A. Taken together, our study provides the first comprehensive picture of the evolution of HHV-6, and reveals that integration of heritable HHV-6 has occurred since the time of, if not before, human migrations out of Africa.},

They have been found in all placental mammals in which they have been searched, including marsupials. Placental structures are not restricted to mammals but also emerged in some other vertebrates, most frequently in lizards, such as the viviparous
              Mabuya
              Scincidae. Here, we performed high-throughput RNA sequencing of a
              Mabuya
              placenta transcriptome and screened for the presence of retroviral
              env
              genes with a full-length ORF. We identified one such gene, which we named “
              syncytin-Mab1
              ,” that has all the characteristics expected for a syncytin gene. It encodes a membrane-bound envelope protein with fusogenic activity ex vivo, is expressed at the placental level as revealed by in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry, and is conserved in all
              Mabuya
              species tested, spanning over 25 My of evolution. Its cognate receptor, required for its fusogenic activity, was searched for by a screening assay using the GeneBridge4 human/Chinese hamster radiation hybrid panel and found to be the MPZL1 gene, previously identified in mammals as a signal-transducing transmembrane protein involved in cell migration. Together, these results show that syncytin capture is not restricted to placental mammals, but can also take place in the rare nonmammalian vertebrates in which a viviparous placentotrophic mode of reproduction emerged. It suggests that similar molecular tools have been used for the convergent evolution of placentation in independently evolved and highly distant vertebrates.},

Signatures are predictive models which describe protein families, domains or sites, and are provided by multiple databases. InterPro combines signatures representing equivalent families, domains or sites, and provides additional information such as descriptions, literature references and Gene Ontology (GO) terms, to produce a comprehensive resource for protein classification. Founded in 1999, InterPro has become one of the most widely used resources for protein family annotation.

	abstract = {ABSTRACT
          Dating the tree of life is central to understanding the evolution of life on Earth. Molecular clocks calibrated with fossils represent the state of the art for inferring the ages of major groups. Yet, other information on the timing of species diversification can be used to date the tree of life. For example, horizontal gene transfer events and ancient coevolutionary relationships such as (endo)symbioses can imply temporal relationships between two nodes in a phylogeny (Davín et al. 2018). These alternative sources of temporal constraints can be particularly helpful when the geological record is sparse, e.g. for microorganisms, which represent the vast majority of extant and extinct biodiversity.
          Here, we present a new method to combine fossil calibrations and relative age constraints to estimate chronograms. We provide an implementation of relative age constraints in RevBayes (Höhna et al. 2016) that can be combined in a modular manner with the wide range of molecular dating methods available in the software.
          We use both realistic simulations and empirical datasets of 40 Cyanobacteria and 62 Archaea to evaluate our method. We show that the combination of relative age constraints with fossil calibrations significantly improves the estimation of node ages.},

	abstract = {Abstract
            Our knowledge of the diversity and frequency of genomic structural variation segregating in populations of large double-stranded (ds) DNA viruses is limited. Here, we sequenced the genome of a baculovirus (Autographa californica multiple nucleopolyhedrovirus [AcMNPV]) purified from beet armyworm (Spodoptera exigua) larvae at depths \&gt;195,000× using both short- (Illumina) and long-read (PacBio) technologies. Using a pipeline relying on hierarchical clustering of structural variants (SVs) detected in individual short- and long-reads by six variant callers, we identified a total of 1,141 SVs in AcMNPV, including 464 deletions, 443 inversions, 160 duplications, and 74 insertions. These variants are considered robust and unlikely to result from technical artifacts because they were independently detected in at least three long reads as well as at least three short reads. SVs are distributed along the entire AcMNPV genome and may involve large genomic regions (30,496 bp on average). We show that no less than 39.9 per cent of genomes carry at least one SV in AcMNPV populations, that the vast majority of SVs (75\%) segregate at very low frequency (\&lt;0.01\%) and that very few SVs persist after ten replication cycles, consistent with a negative impact of most SVs on AcMNPV fitness. Using short-read sequencing datasets, we then show that populations of two iridoviruses and one herpesvirus are also full of SVs, as they contain between 426 and 1,102 SVs carried by 52.4–80.1 per cent of genomes. Finally, AcMNPV long reads allowed us to identify 1,757 transposable elements (TEs) insertions, 895 of which are truncated and occur at one extremity of the reads. This further supports the role of baculoviruses as possible vectors of horizontal transfer of TEs. Altogether, we found that SVs, which evolve mostly under rapid dynamics of gain and loss in viral populations, represent an important feature in the biology of large dsDNA viruses.},

We examine a piRNA-based immunity that relies on the acquisition of viral derived cDNA (vDNA) and how this pathway discriminates between self and non-self. The piRNAs derived from these vDNAs are essential for virus control and Piwi4 has a central role in the pathway. Piwi4 binds preferentially to virus-derived piRNAs but not to transposon-targeting piRNAs. Analysis of episomal vDNA from infected cells reveals that vDNA molecules are acquired through a discriminatory process of reverse-transcription and recombination directed by endogenous retrotransposons. Using a high-resolution Ae. aegypti genomic sequence, we found that vDNAs integrated in the host genome as endogenous viral elements (EVEs), produce antisense piRNAs that are preferentially loaded onto Piwi4. Importantly, EVE-derived piRNAs are specifically loaded onto Piwi4 to inhibit virus replication. Thus, Ae. aegypti employs a sophisticated antiviral mechanism that promotes viral persistence and generates long-lasting adaptive immunity.},

Within eukaryotes, the majority of HTs reported so far are transfers of transposable elements (TEs). These reports essentially come from studies focusing on specific lineages or types of TEs. Because of the lack of large-scale survey, the amount and impact of HT of TEs (HTT) in eukaryote evolution, as well as the trends and factors shaping these transfers, are poorly known. Here, we report a comprehensive analysis of HTT in 195 insect genomes, representing 123 genera and 13 of the 28 insect orders. We found that these insects were involved in at least 2,248 HTT events that essentially occurred during the last 10 My. We show that DNA transposons transfer horizontally more often than retrotransposons, and unveil phylogenetic relatedness and geographical proximity as major factors facilitating HTT in insects. Even though our study is restricted to a small fraction of insect biodiversity and to a recent evolutionary timeframe, the TEs we found to be horizontally transferred generated up to 24\% (2.08\% on average) of all nucleotides of insect genomes. Together, our results establish HTT as a major force shaping insect genome evolution.},

	abstract = {Arthropod genomes contain sequences derived from integrations of DNA and nonretroviral RNA viruses. These sequences, known as endogenous viral elements (EVEs), have been acquired over the course of evolution and have been proposed to serve as a record of past viral infections. Recent evidence indicates that EVEs can function as templates for the biogenesis of PIWI-interacting RNAs (piRNAs) in some mosquito species and cell lines, raising the possibility that EVEs may serve as a source of immunological memory in these organisms. However, whether piRNAs are derived from EVEs or serve an antiviral function in other arthropod species is unknown. Here, we used publicly available genome assemblies and small RNA sequencing data sets to characterize the repertoire and function of EVEs across 48 arthropod genomes. We found that EVEs are widespread in arthropod genomes and primarily correspond to unclassiﬁed single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) viruses and viruses belonging to the Rhabdoviridae and Parvoviridae families. Additionally, EVEs were enriched in piRNA clusters in a majority of species, and we found that production of primary piRNAs from EVEs is common, particularly for EVEs located within piRNA clusters. While the abundance of EVEs within arthropod genomes and the frequency with which EVEs give rise to primary piRNAs generally support the hypothesis that EVEs contribute to an antiviral response via the piRNA pathway, limited nucleotide identity between currently described viruses and EVEs identiﬁed here likely limits the extent to which this process plays a role during infection with known viruses in the arthropod species analyzed.},

	abstract = {Many emerging arboviruses are not transmitted by traditional mosquito vectors, but by lesser-studied arthropods such as ticks, midges, and sand ﬂies. Small RNA (sRNA) silencing pathways are the main antiviral defence mechanism for arthropods, which lack adaptive immunity. Non-retroviral integrated RNA virus sequences (NIRVS) are one potential source of sRNAs which comprise these pathways. NIRVS are remnants of past germline RNA viral infections, where viral cDNA integrates into the host genome and is vertically transmitted. In Aedes mosquitoes, NIRVS are widespread and produce PIWI-interacting RNAs (piRNAs). These are hypothesised to target incoming viral transcripts to modulate viral titre, perhaps rendering the organism a more efﬁcient arbovirus vector. To explore the NIRVS landscape in alternative arbovirus vectors, we validated the NIRVS landscape in Aedes spp. and then identiﬁed novel NIRVS in six medically relevant arthropods and also in Drosophila melanogaster. We identiﬁed novel NIRVS in Phlebotomus papatasi, Culicoides sonorensis, Rhipicephalus microplus, Anopheles gambiae, Culex quinquefasciatus, and Ixodes scapularis. Due to their unexpected abundance, we further characterised NIRVS in the blacklegged tick I. scapularis (n = 143). Interestingly, NIRVS are not enriched in R. microplus, another hard tick, suggesting this is an Ixodes-speciﬁc adaptation. I. scapularis NIRVS are enriched in bunya- and orthomyxo-like sequences, reﬂecting that ticks are a dominant host for these virus groups. Unlike in mosquitoes, I. scapularis NIRVS are more commonly derived from the nonstructural region (replicase) of negative-sense viruses, as opposed to structural regions (e.g. glycoprotein). Like other arthropods, I. scapularis NIRVS preferentially integrate into genomic piRNA clusters, and serve as a template for primary piRNA production in the commonly used embryonic I. scapularis ISE6 cell line. Interestingly, we identiﬁed a two-fold enrichment of nonlong terminal repeat (non-LTR) retrotransposons, in genomic proximity to NIRVS, contrasting with studeis in Ae. aegypti, where LTR retrotransposons are instead associated with NIRVS formation. We characterised NIRVS phylogeny and integration patterns in the important vector, I. scapularis, revealing they are distinct from those in Aedes spp. Future studies will explore the possible antiviral mechanism conferred by NIRVS to I. scapularis,which may help the transmission of pathogenic arboviruses. Finally, this study explored NIRVS as an untapped wealth of viral diversity in arthropods.},

            As viral genomic imprints in host genomes, endogenous viral elements (EVEs) shed light on the deep evolutionary history of viruses, ancestral host ranges, and ancient viral-host interactions. In addition, they may provide crucial information for calibrating viral evolutionary timescales. In this study, we conducted a comprehensive
            in silico
            screening of a large dataset of available mammalian genomes for EVEs deriving from members of the viral family
            Flaviviridae
            , an important group of viruses including well-known human pathogens. We identified two novel pestivirus-like EVEs in the reference genome of the Indochinese shrew (
            Crocidura indochinensis
            ). Homologs of these novel EVEs were subsequently detected
            in vivo
            by molecular detection and sequencing in 27 shrew species, including 26 species representing a wide distribution within the Crocidurinae subfamily and one in the Soricinae subfamily. Based on this wide distribution, we estimate that the integration event occurred before the last common ancestor of the subfamily, about 10.8 million years ago, attesting to an ancient origin of pestiviruses and
            Flaviviridae
            in general. Moreover, we provide the first description of
            Flaviviridae
            -derived EVEs in mammals even though the family encompasses numerous mammal-infecting members, including major human pathogens such as Zika, dengue, or hepatitis C viruses. This also suggests that shrews were past and perhaps also current natural reservoirs of pestiviruses. Taken together, our results expand the current known
            Pestivirus
            host range and provide novel insight into the ancient evolutionary history of pestiviruses and the
            Flaviviridae

	abstract = {Insects are known to host a wide variety of beneficial microbes that are fundamental to many aspects of their biology and have substantially shaped their evolution. Notably, parasitoid wasps have repeatedly evolved beneficial associations with viruses that enable developing wasps to survive as parasites that feed from other insects. Ongoing genomic sequencing efforts have revealed that most of these virus-derived entities are fully integrated into the genomes of parasitoid wasp lineages, representing endogenous viral elements (EVEs) that retain the ability to produce virus or virus-like particles within wasp reproductive tissues. All documented parasitoid EVEs have undergone similar genomic rearrangements compared to their viral ancestors characterized by viral genes scattered across wasp genomes and specific viral gene losses. The recurrent presence of viral endogenization and genomic reorganization in beneficial virus systems identified to date suggest that these features are crucial to forming heritable alliances between parasitoid wasps and viruses. Here, our genomic characterization of a mutualistic poxvirus associated with the wasp
              Diachasmimorpha longicaudata
              , known as Diachasmimorpha longicaudata entomopoxvirus (DlEPV), has uncovered the first instance of beneficial virus evolution that does not conform to the genomic architecture shared by parasitoid EVEs with which it displays evolutionary convergence. Rather, DlEPV retains the exogenous viral genome of its poxvirus ancestor and the majority of conserved poxvirus core genes. Additional comparative analyses indicate that DlEPV is related to a fly pathogen and contains a novel gene expansion that may be adaptive to its symbiotic role. Finally, differential expression analysis during virus replication in wasps and fly hosts demonstrates a unique mechanism of functional partitioning that allows DlEPV to persist within and provide benefit to its parasitoid wasp host.},

            ABSTRACT
            
              Increasing data indicate that insects serve as major reservoirs and vectors of viruses, which account for the continuously increasing ecological burden and infectious disease outbreaks. Uncovering the hidden diversity of viruses in insects will further the understanding of the ecological and evolutionary perspectives in the emergence of insect-associated virus diseases. In this study, we queried transcriptome sequencing (RNA-Seq) data from more than 600 species across 32 insect orders dwelling in different ecological habitats and recovered more than 1,213 RNA viruses that were recapitulated in 40 families, 2 unclassified genera, and many unspecified viral groups. These novel viruses included the well-known insect-associated viruses within
              Flaviviridae
              ,
              Picornavirales
              ,
              Bunyavirales
              ,
              Mononegavirales
              ,
              Nidovirales
              ,
              Reoviridae
              , and
              Negevirus
              . More appeared to form novel clusters within previously described taxa or could be resolved as paraphyletic, including the first astrovirus identified in insects, in which many were sufficiently divergent to warrant the establishment of new virus genera or families. Additionally, some viruses were closely related to the recognized plant-, fungus-, and vertebrate-specific species, implying the importance of relationships between insect behavior and virus spread. Comparative genome analyses also revealed high genomic variability with respect to the flexible gene pool and genome architecture of these newly described viruses, including the evidence for genome reshuffling first discovered in
              Dicistroviridae
              . The data reflecting the genetically and ecologically diverse viral populations in insects greatly expand our understanding of RNA viruses in nature and highlight that the biodiversity of RNA viruses remains largely unexplored.

	abstract = {Viruses encoding a replication-associated protein (Rep) within a covalently closed, single-stranded (ss)DNA genome are among the smallest viruses known to infect eukaryotic organisms, including economically valuable agricultural crops and livestock. Although circular Rep-encoding ssDNA (CRESS DNA) viruses are a widespread group for which our knowledge is rapidly expanding, biased sampling toward vertebrates and land plants has limited our understanding of their diversity and evolution. Here, we screened terrestrial arthropods for CRESS DNA viruses and report the identification of 44 viral genomes and replicons associated with specimens representing all three major terrestrial arthropod lineages, namely Euchelicerata (spiders), Hexapoda (insects), and Myriapoda (millipedes). We identified virus genomes belonging to three established CRESS DNA viral families (
              Circoviridae
              ,
              Genomoviridae
              , and
              Smacoviridae
              ); however, over half of the arthropod-associated viral genomes are only distantly related to currently classified CRESS DNA viral sequences. Although members of viral and satellite families known to infect plants (
              Geminiviridae
              ,
              Nanoviridae
              ,
              Alphasatellitidae
              ) were not identified in this study, these plant-infecting CRESS DNA viruses and replicons are transmitted by hemipterans. Therefore, members from six out of the seven established CRESS DNA viral families circulate among arthropods. Furthermore, a phylogenetic analysis of Reps, including endogenous viral sequences, reported to date from a wide array of organisms revealed that most of the known CRESS DNA viral diversity circulates among invertebrates. Our results highlight the vast and unexplored diversity of CRESS DNA viruses among invertebrates and parallel findings from RNA viral discovery efforts in undersampled taxa.},

	abstract = {ABSTRACT
            Human parvovirus B19 (B19V) infection of human erythroid progenitor cells (EPCs) induces a DNA damage response and cell cycle arrest at late S phase, which facilitates viral DNA replication. However, it is not clear exactly which cellular factors are employed by this single-stranded DNA virus. Here, we used microarrays to systematically analyze the dynamic transcriptome of EPCs infected with B19V. We found that DNA metabolism, DNA replication, DNA repair, DNA damage response, cell cycle, and cell cycle arrest pathways were significantly regulated after B19V infection. Confocal microscopy analyses revealed that most cellular DNA replication proteins were recruited to the centers of viral DNA replication, but not the DNA repair DNA polymerases. Our results suggest that DNA replication polymerase δ and polymerase α are responsible for B19V DNA replication by knocking down its expression in EPCs. We further showed that although RPA32 is essential for B19V DNA replication and the phosphorylated forms of RPA32 colocalized with the replicating viral genomes, RPA32 phosphorylation was not necessary for B19V DNA replication. Thus, this report provides evidence that B19V uses the cellular DNA replication machinery for viral DNA replication.
            
              IMPORTANCE
              Human parvovirus B19 (B19V) infection can cause transient aplastic crisis, persistent viremia, and pure red cell aplasia. In fetuses, B19V infection can result in nonimmune hydrops fetalis and fetal death. These clinical manifestations of B19V infection are a direct outcome of the death of human erythroid progenitors that host B19V replication. B19V infection induces a DNA damage response that is important for cell cycle arrest at late S phase. Here, we analyzed dynamic changes in cellular gene expression and found that DNA metabolic processes are tightly regulated during B19V infection. Although genes involved in cellular DNA replication were downregulated overall, the cellular DNA replication machinery was tightly associated with the replicating single-stranded DNA viral genome and played a critical role in viral DNA replication. In contrast, the DNA damage response-induced phosphorylated forms of RPA32 were dispensable for viral DNA replication.},

Because the types and sequences of TEs are highly variable across species, automated TE discovery and annotation are challenging and time-consuming tasks. A critical first step is the de novo identification and accurate compilation of sequence models representing all of the unique TE families dispersed in the genome. Here we introduce RepeatModeler2, a pipeline that greatly facilitates this process. This program brings substantial improvements over the original version of RepeatModeler, one of the most widely used tools for TE discovery. In particular, this version incorporates a module for structural discovery of complete long terminal repeat (LTR) retroelements, which are widespread in eukaryotic genomes but recalcitrant to automated identification because of their size and sequence complexity. We benchmarked RepeatModeler2 on three model species with diverse TE landscapes and high-quality, manually curated TE libraries:
              Drosophila melanogaster
              (fruit fly),
              Danio rerio
              (zebrafish), and
              Oryza sativa
              (rice). In these three species, RepeatModeler2 identified approximately 3 times more consensus sequences matching with {\textgreater}95\% sequence identity and sequence coverage to the manually curated sequences than the original RepeatModeler. As expected, the greatest improvement is for LTR retroelements. Thus, RepeatModeler2 represents a valuable addition to the genome annotation toolkit that will enhance the identification and study of TEs in eukaryotic genome sequences.

            SUMMARY
            Viruses and mobile genetic elements are molecular parasites or symbionts that coevolve with nearly all forms of cellular life. The route of virus replication and protein expression is determined by the viral genome type. Comparison of these routes led to the classification of viruses into seven “Baltimore classes” (BCs) that define the major features of virus reproduction. However, recent phylogenomic studies identified multiple evolutionary connections among viruses within each of the BCs as well as between different classes. Due to the modular organization of virus genomes, these relationships defy simple representation as lines of descent but rather form complex networks. Phylogenetic analyses of virus hallmark genes combined with analyses of gene-sharing networks show that replication modules of five BCs (three classes of RNA viruses and two classes of reverse-transcribing viruses) evolved from a common ancestor that encoded an RNA-directed RNA polymerase or a reverse transcriptase. Bona fide viruses evolved from this ancestor on multiple, independent occasions via the recruitment of distinct cellular proteins as capsid subunits and other structural components of virions. The single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) viruses are a polyphyletic class, with different groups evolving by recombination between rolling-circle-replicating plasmids, which contributed the replication protein, and positive-sense RNA viruses, which contributed the capsid protein. The double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) viruses are distributed among several large monophyletic groups and arose via the combination of distinct structural modules with equally diverse replication modules. Phylogenomic analyses reveal the finer structure of evolutionary connections among RNA viruses and reverse-transcribing viruses, ssDNA viruses, and large subsets of dsDNA viruses. Taken together, these analyses allow us to outline the global organization of the virus world. Here, we describe the key aspects of this organization and propose a comprehensive hierarchical taxonomy of viruses.},

            ABSTRACT
            
              Increasing data indicate that insects serve as major reservoirs and vectors of viruses, which account for the continuously increasing ecological burden and infectious disease outbreaks. Uncovering the hidden diversity of viruses in insects will further the understanding of the ecological and evolutionary perspectives in the emergence of insect-associated virus diseases. In this study, we queried transcriptome sequencing (RNA-Seq) data from more than 600 species across 32 insect orders dwelling in different ecological habitats and recovered more than 1,213 RNA viruses that were recapitulated in 40 families, 2 unclassified genera, and many unspecified viral groups. These novel viruses included the well-known insect-associated viruses within
              Flaviviridae
              ,
              Picornavirales
              ,
              Bunyavirales
              ,
              Mononegavirales
              ,
              Nidovirales
              ,
              Reoviridae
              , and
              Negevirus
              . More appeared to form novel clusters within previously described taxa or could be resolved as paraphyletic, including the first astrovirus identified in insects, in which many were sufficiently divergent to warrant the establishment of new virus genera or families. Additionally, some viruses were closely related to the recognized plant-, fungus-, and vertebrate-specific species, implying the importance of relationships between insect behavior and virus spread. Comparative genome analyses also revealed high genomic variability with respect to the flexible gene pool and genome architecture of these newly described viruses, including the evidence for genome reshuffling first discovered in
              Dicistroviridae
              . The data reflecting the genetically and ecologically diverse viral populations in insects greatly expand our understanding of RNA viruses in nature and highlight that the biodiversity of RNA viruses remains largely unexplored.

              Summary
              Searching for open reading frames is a routine task and a critical step prior to annotating protein coding regions in newly sequenced genomes or de novo transcriptome assemblies. With the tremendous increase in genomic and transcriptomic data, faster tools are needed to handle large input datasets. These tools should be versatile enough to fine-tune search criteria and allow efficient downstream analysis. Here we present a new python based tool, orfipy, which allows the user to flexibly search for open reading frames in genomic and transcriptomic sequences. The search is rapid and is fully customizable, with a choice of FASTA and BED output formats.
            
            
              Availability and implementation
              orfipy is implemented in python and is compatible with python v3.6 and higher. Source code: https://github.com/urmi-21/orfipy. Installation: from the source, or via PyPi (https://pypi.org/project/orfipy) or bioconda (https://anaconda.org/bioconda/orfipy).

            ABSTRACT
            Enveloped viruses hijack cellular membranes in order to provide the necessary material for virion assembly. In particular, viruses that replicate and assemble inside the nucleus have developed special approaches to modify the nuclear landscape for their advantage. We used electron microscopy to investigate cellular changes occurring during nudivirus infection and we characterized a unique mechanism for assembly, packaging, and transport of new virions across the nuclear membrane and through the cytoplasm. Our three-dimensional reconstructions describe the complex remodeling of the nuclear membrane necessary to release vesicle-associated viruses into the cytoplasm. This is the first report of nuclear morphological reconfigurations that occur during nudiviral infection.
            
              IMPORTANCE
              The dynamics of nuclear envelope has a critical role in multiple cellular processes. However, little is known regarding the structural changes occurring inside the nucleus or at the inner and outer nuclear membranes. For viruses assembling inside the nucleus, remodeling of the intranuclear membrane plays an important role in the process of virion assembly. Here, we monitored the changes associated with viral infection in the case of nudiviruses. Our data revealed dramatic membrane remodeling inside the nuclear compartment during infection with

              Parvoviruses infect humans and a broad range of animals, from mammals to crustaceans, and generally are associated with a variety of acute and chronic diseases. However, many others cause persistent infections and are not known to be associated with any disease. Viral persistence is likely related to the ability to integrate into the chromosomal DNA and to establish a latent infection. However, there is little evidence for genome integration of parvoviral DNA except for
              Adeno-associated virus
              (AAV). Here we performed a systematic search for homologs of parvoviral proteins in publicly available eukaryotic genome databases followed by experimental verification and phylogenetic analysis. We conclude that parvoviruses have frequently invaded the germ lines of diverse animal species, including mammals, fishes, birds, tunicates, arthropods, and flatworms. The identification of orthologous endogenous parvovirus sequences in the genomes of humans and other mammals suggests that parvoviruses have coexisted with mammals for at least 98 million years. Furthermore, some of the endogenized parvoviral genes were expressed in eukaryotic organisms, suggesting that these viral genes are also functional in the host genomes. Our findings may provide novel insights into parvovirus biology, host interactions, and evolution.},

	abstract = {Although arthropods are important viral vectors, the biodiversity of arthropod viruses, as well as the role that arthropods have played in viral origins and evolution, is unclear. Through RNA sequencing of 70 arthropod species we discovered 112 novel viruses that appear to be ancestral to much of the documented genetic diversity of negative-sense RNA viruses, a number of which are also present as endogenous genomic copies. With this greatly enriched diversity we revealed that arthropods contain viruses that fall basal to major virus groups, including the vertebrate-specific arenaviruses, filoviruses, hantaviruses, influenza viruses, lyssaviruses, and paramyxoviruses. We similarly documented a remarkable diversity of genome structures in arthropod viruses, including a putative circular form, that sheds new light on the evolution of genome organization. Hence, arthropods are a major reservoir of viral genetic diversity and have likely been central to viral evolution.
          , 
            Many illnesses, including influenza, hemorrhagic fever, and rabies, are caused by a group of viruses called negative-sense RNA viruses. The genetic information—or genome—of these viruses is encoded in strands of RNA that must be copied before they can be translated into the proteins needed to build new viruses. It is currently known that there are at least eight different families of these viruses, which have a wide range of shapes and sizes and arrange their RNA in different ways.
            Insects, spiders, and other arthropods carry many different RNA viruses. Many of these viruses have not previously been studied, and those that have been studied so far are mainly those that cause diseases in humans and other vertebrates. Researchers therefore only know a limited amount about the diversity of the negative-sense RNA viruses that arthropods harbor and how these viruses evolved. Studying how viruses evolve helps scientists to understand what makes some viruses deadly and others harmless and can also help develop treatments or vaccines for the diseases caused by the viruses.
            Li, Shi, Tian, Lin, Kang et al. collected 70 species of insects, spiders, centipedes, and other arthropods in China and sequenced all the negative-sense RNA viruses in the creatures. This revealed an enormous number of negative-sense RNA viruses, including 112 new viruses. Many of the newly discovered arthropod viruses appear to be the ancestors of disease-causing viruses, including influenza viruses and the filoviruses—the group that includes the Ebola virus. Indeed, it appears that arthropods host many—if not all—of the negative-sense RNA viruses that cause disease in vertebrates and plants.
            While documenting the new RNA viruses and how they are related to each other, Li et al. found many different genome structures. Some genomes were segmented, which may play an important role in evolution as segments can be easily swapped to create new genetic combinations. Non-segmented and circular genomes were also found. This genetic diversity suggests that arthropods are likely to have played a key role in the evolution of new viruses by acting as a site where many different viruses can interact and exchange genetic information.},

Phylogenetic analyses of virus hallmark genes combined with analyses of gene-sharing networks show that replication modules of five BCs (three classes of RNA viruses and two classes of reverse-transcribing viruses) evolved from a common ancestor that encoded an RNA-directed RNA polymerase or a reverse transcriptase. Bona fide viruses evolved from this ancestor on multiple, independent occasions via the recruitment of distinct cellular proteins as capsid subunits and other structural components of virions. The single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) viruses are a polyphyletic class, with different groups evolving by recombination between rolling-circle-replicating plasmids, which contributed the replication protein, and positive-sense RNA viruses, which contributed the capsid protein. The double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) viruses are distributed among several large monophyletic groups and arose via the combination of distinct structural modules with equally diverse replication modules. Phylogenomic analyses reveal the finer structure of evolutionary connections among RNA viruses and reverse-transcribing viruses, ssDNA viruses, and large subsets of dsDNA viruses. Taken together, these analyses allow us to outline the global organization of the virus world.

No data is currently available on the virion morphology for viruses in the genera Dioscovirus and Vaccinivirus. Members of the Caulimoviridae infect a wide range of monocot and dicot plants, although members of a single species have generally narrow host ranges. Some viruses of this family cause economically important diseases of tropical and subtropical crops. Insect vectors have been identiﬁed for badnaviruses, caulimoviruses and tungroviruses. Endogenous viral elements (EVEs; viral DNA integrated into the host nuclear genome) are known for badnaviruses, caulimoviruses, cavemoviruses, petuviruses and solendoviruses. Some caulimovirid EVEs in Musa balbisiana, Petunia hybrida and Nicotiana edwardsonii are replication competent and can lead to spontaneous infections by episomal forms of the viral genome through activation by biotic or abiotic stresses. However, the majority of caulimovirid EVEs, which are widespread in the genomes of vascular plants, are considered to be replication defective.},

	abstract = {ABSTRACT
            
              Polydnaviruses form a group of unconventional double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) viruses transmitted by endoparasitic wasps during egg laying into caterpillar hosts, where viral gene expression is essential to immature wasp survival. A copy of the viral genome is present in wasp chromosomes, thus ensuring vertical transmission. Polydnaviruses comprise two taxa,
              Bracovirus
              and
              Ichnovirus
              , shown to have distinct viral ancestors whose genomes were “captured” by ancestral wasps. While evidence indicates that bracoviruses derive from a nudivirus ancestor, the identity of the ichnovirus progenitor remains unknown. In addition, ichnoviruses are found in two ichneumonid wasp subfamilies, Campopleginae and Banchinae, where they constitute morphologically and genomically different virus types. To address the question of whether these two ichnovirus subgroups have distinct ancestors, we used genomic, proteomic, and transcriptomic analyses to characterize particle proteins of the banchine
              Glypta fumiferanae
              ichnovirus and the genes encoding them. Several proteins were found to be homologous to those identified earlier for campoplegine ichnoviruses while the corresponding genes were located in clusters of the wasp genome similar to those observed previously in a campoplegine wasp. However, for the first time in a polydnavirus system, these clusters also revealed sequences encoding enzymes presumed to form the replicative machinery of the progenitor virus and observed to be overexpressed in the virogenic tissue. Homology searches pointed to nucleocytoplasmic large DNA viruses as the likely source of these genes. These data, along with an analysis of the chromosomal form of five viral genome segments, provide clear evidence for the relatedness of the banchine and campoplegine ichnovirus ancestors.
            
            
              IMPORTANCE
              Recent work indicates that the two recognized polydnavirus taxa,
              Bracovirus
              and
              Ichnovirus
              , are derived from distinct viruses whose genomes integrated into the genomes of ancestral wasps. However, the identity of the ichnovirus ancestor is unknown, and questions remain regarding the possibility that the two described ichnovirus subgroups, banchine and campoplegine ichnoviruses, have distinct origins. Our study provides unequivocal evidence that these two ichnovirus types are derived from related viral progenitors. This suggests that morphological and genomic differences observed between the ichnovirus lineages, including features unique to banchine ichnovirus genome segments, result from evolutionary divergence either before or after their endogenization. Strikingly, analysis of selected wasp genomic regions revealed genes presumed to be part of the replicative machinery of the progenitor virus, shedding new light on the likely identity of this virus. Finally, these genes could well play a role in ichnovirus replication as they were overexpressed in the virogenic tissue.},

	abstract = {Abstract
            The Ichneumonoidea (Ichneumonidae and Braconidae) is an incredibly diverse superfamily of parasitoid wasps that includes species that produce virus-like entities in their reproductive tracts to promote successful parasitism of host insects. Research on these entities has traditionally focused upon two viral genera Bracovirus (in Braconidae) and Ichnovirus (in Ichneumonidae). These viruses are produced using genes known collectively as endogenous viral elements (EVEs) that represent historical, now heritable viral integration events in wasp genomes. Here, new genome sequence assemblies for 11 species and 6 publicly available genomes from the Ichneumonoidea were screened with the goal of identifying novel EVEs and characterizing the breadth of species in lineages with known EVEs. Exhaustive similarity searches combined with the identification of ancient core genes revealed sequences from both known and novel EVEs. One species harbored a novel, independently derived EVE related to a divergent large double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) virus that manipulates behavior in other hymenopteran species. Although bracovirus or ichnovirus EVEs were identified as expected in three species, the absence of ichnoviruses in several species suggests that they are independently derived and present in two younger, less widespread lineages than previously thought. Overall, this study presents a novel bioinformatic approach for EVE discovery in genomes and shows that three divergent virus families (nudiviruses, the ancestors of ichnoviruses, and Leptopilina boulardi Filamentous Virus-like viruses) are recurrently acquired as EVEs in parasitoid wasps. Virus acquisition in the parasitoid wasps is a common process that has occurred in many more than two lineages from a diverse range of arthropod-infecting dsDNA viruses.},

Notably, sequences of more than 60 nudiviral genes were identified from de novo assembled DNA contigs, and mapped to assembled genomic scaffolds of AG, indicating that an ancient nudivirus, named Aphis glycines endogenous nudivirus (AgENV), had integrated into the AG genome. Furthermore, sequences derived from a similar endogenous nudivirus, Melanaphis sacchari endogenous nudivirus (MsENV), were identified from the genomic scaffolds of the sugarcane aphid, Melanaphis sacchari. Analysis of transcriptome and small RNA sequence data derived from AG did not provide evidence for transcription of the integrated AgENV genes. Hence, the genes of AgENV may be present as pseudogenes. Phylogenetic analysis based on nudivirus core genes indicated that these aphid ENVs belong to the genus Alphanudivirus.},

	abstract = {In parasitoids, the adaptive signiﬁcance of superparasitism (laying of egg(s) in already parasitized hosts) has been the subject of strong controversy. The current view is to interpret this behaviour as an adaptation to increased competition for hosts, because the supernumerary egg still has a chance to win possession for the host. However, we recently discovered that in the solitary parasitoid Leptopilina boulardi, superparasitism is rather caused by an unknown infectious element: stable non superparasitizing lineages (NS) are transformed into stable superparasitizing lineages (S) after eggs from both lineages have competed inside the same host (superparasitism). In this report, we investigate the nature and location of the causative agent. Involvement of bacteria is unlikely because antibiotic treatments do not affect wasp phenotype and because bacterial 16S ribosomal DNA was not detected using PCR. We report successful injection experiments showing that the causative agents are located in wasp poison gland and ovaries and are stably inherited. Electron microscopic studies demonstrate that long ﬁlamentous virus particles located in wasp oviducts are strongly associated with superparasitism behaviour, leading to reconsider the adaptive signiﬁcance of this behaviour in parasitoids. Interestingly, parasitoids are often infected with similar viruses for which no phenotypic effect has been documented. This raises the possibility that they could induce the same behavioural manipulation.},

With the discovery of several nucleocytoplasmic large DNA viruses (NCLDVs) and jumbo phages, the relationship between particle and genome sizes has emerged as an important criterion for understanding virus evolution. We use allometric scaling of capsid volume with the genome length of different groups of viruses to shed light on its relationship with virus life history. The allometric exponents for icosahedral dsDNA bacteriophages and NCDLVs were found to be 1 and 2, respectively, indicating that with increasing capsid size DNA packaging density remains the same in bacteriophages but decreases for NCLDVs. We argue that the exponents are largely shaped by their entry mechanism and capsid mechanical stability. We further show that these allometric size parameters are also intricately linked to the relative energy costs of translation and replication in viruses and can have further implications on viral life history.},

	abstract = {Although arthropods are important viral vectors, the biodiversity of arthropod viruses, as well as the role that arthropods have played in viral origins and evolution, is unclear. Through RNA sequencing of 70 arthropod species we discovered 112 novel viruses that appear to be ancestral to much of the documented genetic diversity of negative-sense RNA viruses, a number of which are also present as endogenous genomic copies. With this greatly enriched diversity we revealed that arthropods contain viruses that fall basal to major virus groups, including the vertebrate-specific arenaviruses, filoviruses, hantaviruses, influenza viruses, lyssaviruses, and paramyxoviruses. We similarly documented a remarkable diversity of genome structures in arthropod viruses, including a putative circular form, that sheds new light on the evolution of genome organization. Hence, arthropods are a major reservoir of viral genetic diversity and have likely been central to viral evolution.
          , 
            Many illnesses, including influenza, hemorrhagic fever, and rabies, are caused by a group of viruses called negative-sense RNA viruses. The genetic information—or genome—of these viruses is encoded in strands of RNA that must be copied before they can be translated into the proteins needed to build new viruses. It is currently known that there are at least eight different families of these viruses, which have a wide range of shapes and sizes and arrange their RNA in different ways.
            Insects, spiders, and other arthropods carry many different RNA viruses. Many of these viruses have not previously been studied, and those that have been studied so far are mainly those that cause diseases in humans and other vertebrates. Researchers therefore only know a limited amount about the diversity of the negative-sense RNA viruses that arthropods harbor and how these viruses evolved. Studying how viruses evolve helps scientists to understand what makes some viruses deadly and others harmless and can also help develop treatments or vaccines for the diseases caused by the viruses.
            Li, Shi, Tian, Lin, Kang et al. collected 70 species of insects, spiders, centipedes, and other arthropods in China and sequenced all the negative-sense RNA viruses in the creatures. This revealed an enormous number of negative-sense RNA viruses, including 112 new viruses. Many of the newly discovered arthropod viruses appear to be the ancestors of disease-causing viruses, including influenza viruses and the filoviruses—the group that includes the Ebola virus. Indeed, it appears that arthropods host many—if not all—of the negative-sense RNA viruses that cause disease in vertebrates and plants.
            While documenting the new RNA viruses and how they are related to each other, Li et al. found many different genome structures. Some genomes were segmented, which may play an important role in evolution as segments can be easily swapped to create new genetic combinations. Non-segmented and circular genomes were also found. This genetic diversity suggests that arthropods are likely to have played a key role in the evolution of new viruses by acting as a site where many different viruses can interact and exchange genetic information.},

	abstract = {Behaviour manipulation imposed by parasites is a fascinating phenomenon but our understanding is still very limited. We studied the interaction between a virus and the parasitic wasp Leptopilina boulardi that attacks Drosophila larvae. Wasps usually refrain to lay eggs into already parasitized hosts (superparasitism avoidance). On the contrary, females infected by the Leptopilina boulardi Filamentous Virus (LbFV) are much more incline to superparasitize. Interestingly, the host-sharing induced by this behaviour modification leads to the horizontal transmission of the virus, thus increasing its fitness at the expense of that of the wasp. To better understand the mechanisms underlying this behaviour manipulation, we studied by RNA sequencing the meta-transcriptome of LbFV and the parasitic wasp both in the abdomen and in the head. We found that the abundance of viral transcripts was independent of the wasp strain but strongly differed between tissues. Based on the tissue pattern of expression, we identified a set of 20 viral genes putatively involved in the manipulation process. In addition, we identified a set of wasp genes deregulated in the presence of the virus either in the abdomen or in the head, including genes with annotations suggesting involvement in behaviour (i.e. Potassium-channel protein). This dataset gives new insights into the behaviour manipulation and on the genetic basis of superparasitism in parasitoids.},

	abstract = {Target enrichment is increasingly used for genotyping of plant and animal species or to better understand the evolutionary history of important lineages through the inference of statistically robust phylogenies. Limitations to routine target enrichment are both the complexity of current protocols and low input DNA quantity. Thus, working with tiny organisms such as microarthropods can be challenging. Here, we propose easy to set up optimisations for DNA extraction and library preparation prior to target enrichment. Prepared libraries were used to capture 1432 Ultra-Conserved Elements (UCEs) from microhymenoptera (Chalcidoidea), which are among the tiniest insects on Earth and the most commercialized worldwide for biological control purposes. Results show no correlation between input DNA quantities (1.8-250ng, 0.4 ng with an extra whole genome amplification step) and the number of sequenced UCEs on an Illumina MiSeq. Phylogenetic inferences highlight the potential of UCEs to solve relationships within the families of chalcid wasps, which has not been achieved so far. The protocol (library preparation + target enrichment), allows processing 96 specimens in five working days, by a single person, without requiring the use of expensive robotic molecular biology platforms, which could help to generalize the use of target enrichment for minute specimens.},

Here, we used ultra-conserved elements and their ﬂanking regions to resolve relationships among 84 species of eulophids included in 63 genera representing all subfamilies and most tribes, plus 15 outgroups. Our analyses recover all traditional Eulophidae subfamilies and tribes with high support and globally agree with the traditional classiﬁcation of the family. Our results conﬁrm that Eulophinae + Tetrastichinae is the sister group of (Opheliminae + Entiinae) + Entedoninae. At the generic level, our analyses provide high support for intergeneric relationships for which morphology and Sanger markers previously failed to provide resolution. Our results also conﬁrm that Trisecodes does not group with Eulophidae and may not belong to this family; however, its correct classiﬁcation still awaits a large-scale phylogenomic hypothesis for Chalcidoidea.

Until now, the absence of unequivocal morphological apomorphies and the low resolution provided by the handful of Sanger sequenced genes have hampered the reconstruction of phylogenetic relationships within the family. Here, we used ultra-conserved elements and their ﬂanking regions to resolve relationships among 84 species of eulophids included in 63 genera representing all subfamilies and most tribes, plus 15 outgroups. Our analyses recover all traditional Eulophidae subfamilies and tribes with high support and globally agree with the traditional classiﬁcation of the family. Our results conﬁrm that Eulophinae + Tetrastichinae is the sister group of (Opheliminae + Entiinae) + Entedoninae. At the generic level, our analyses provide high support for intergeneric relationships for which morphology and Sanger markers previously failed to provide resolution. Our results also conﬁrm that Trisecodes does not group with Eulophidae and may not belong to this family; however, its correct classiﬁcation still awaits a large-scale phylogenomic hypothesis for Chalcidoidea. This work opens new avenues towards a better understanding of the evolutionary history, biogeography and evolution of host–parasitoid associations in this hyper-diverse family of chalcidoid wasps.},

	abstract = {Nonparametric bootstrap has been a widely used tool in phylogenetic analysis to assess the clade support of phylogenetic trees. However, with the rapidly growing amount of data, this task remains a computational bottleneck. Recently, approximation methods such as the RAxML rapid bootstrap (RBS) and the Shimodaira–Hasegawa-like approximate likelihood ratio test have been introduced to speed up the bootstrap. Here, we suggest an ultrafast bootstrap approximation approach (UFBoot) to compute the support of phylogenetic groups in maximum likelihood (ML) based trees. To achieve this, we combine the resampling estimated log-likelihood method with a simple but effective collection scheme of candidate trees. We also propose a stopping rule that assesses the convergence of branch support values to automatically determine when to stop collecting candidate trees. UFBoot achieves a median speed up of 3.1 (range: 0.66–33.3) to 10.2 (range: 1.32–41.4) compared with RAxML RBS for real DNA and amino acid alignments, respectively. Moreover, our extensive simulations show that UFBoot is robust against moderate model violations and the support values obtained appear to be relatively unbiased compared with the conservative standard bootstrap. This provides a more direct interpretation of the bootstrap support. We offer an efﬁcient and easy-to-use software (available at http://www.cibiv. at/software/iqtree) to perform the UFBoot analysis with ML tree inference.},

Molecular clocks are widely used to reveal the recent evolutionary histories of viruses but may severely underestimate their longer-term origins because of the inverse correlation between inferred rates of evolution and the timescale of their measurement. Here, we provide a predictive mechanistic model that readily explains the rate decay phenomenon over a wide range of timescales and recapitulates the ubiquitous power-law rate decay with a slope of À0.65. We show that standard substitution models fail to correctly estimate divergence times once the most rapidly evolving sites saturate, typically after hundreds of years in RNA viruses and thousands of years in DNA viruses. Our model successfully recreates the observed pattern of decay and explains the evolutionary processes behind the time-dependent rate phenomenon. We then apply our model to re-estimate the date of diversiﬁcation of genotypes of hepatitis C virus to 423,000 (95\% highest posterior density [HPD]: 394,000–454,000) years before present, a time preceding the dispersal of modern humans out of Africa, and show that the most recent common ancestor of sarbecoviruses dates back to 21,000 (95\% HPD: 19,000–22,000) years ago, nearly thirty times older than previous estimates. This creates a new perspective for our understanding of the origins of these viruses and also suggests that a substantial revision of evolutionary timescales of other viruses can be similarly achieved.},

One aspect of their small size is the genome compression caused by the use of overlapping genes (where some nucleotides code for two genes). Using a comparative analysis of all known RNA viral species, we show that viruses with larger genomes tend to have less gene overlap. We provide a numerical model to show how a high mutation rate could lead to gene overlap, and we discuss the factors that might explain the observed relationship between gene overlap and genome size. We also propose a model for the evolution of gene overlap based on the co-opting of previously unused ORFs, which gives rise to two types of overlap: (1) the creation of novel genes inside older genes, predominantly via +1 frameshifts, and (2) the incremental increase in overlap between originally contiguous genes, with no frameshift preference. Both types of overlap are viewed as the creation of genomic novelty under pressure for genome compression. Simulations based on our model generate the empirical size distributions of overlaps and explain the observed frameshift preferences. We suggest that RNA viruses are a good model system for the investigation of general evolutionary relationship between genome attributes such as mutational robustness, mutation rate, and size.},

            In recent years, remarkable progress has been made in the field of virus environmental ecology. In marine ecosystems, for example, viruses are now thought to play pivotal roles in the biogeochemical cycling of nutrients and to be mediators of microbial evolution through horizontal gene transfer. The diversity and ecology of viruses in soils are poorly understood, but evidence supports the view that the diversity and ecology of viruses in soils differ substantially from those in aquatic systems. Desert biomes cover ∼33\% of global land masses, and yet the diversity and roles of viruses in these dominant ecosystems remain poorly understood. There is evidence that hot hyperarid desert soils are characterized by high levels of bacterial lysogens and low extracellular virus counts. In contrast, cold desert soils contain high extracellular virus titers. We suggest that the prevalence of microbial biofilms in hyperarid soils, combined with extreme thermal regimens, exerts strong selection pressures on both temperate and virulent viruses. Many desert soil virus sequences show low values of identity to virus genomes in public databases, suggesting the existence of distinct and as-yet-uncharacterized soil phylogenetic lineages (e.g., cyanophages). We strongly advocate for amplification-free metavirome analyses while encouraging the classical isolation of phages from dominant and culturable microbial isolates in order to populate sequence databases. This review provides an overview of recent advances in the study of viruses in hyperarid soils and of the factors that contribute to viral abundance and diversity in hot and cold deserts and offers technical recommendations for future studies.},

The finding of so many new plant viruses that do not cause any obvious symptoms in wild plant hosts certainly changes our perception of viruses and how they interact with their hosts.

              The importance of viruses in marine microbial ecology has been established over the past decade. Specifically, viruses influence bacterial abundance and community composition through lysis and alter bacterial genetic diversity through transduction and lysogenic conversion. By contrast, the abundance and distribution of viruses in soils are almost completely unknown. This study describes the abundance and diversity of autochthonous viruses in six Delaware soils: two agricultural soils, two coastal plain forest soils, and two piedmont forest soils. Viral abundance was measured using epifluorescence microscopy, while viral diversity was assessed from morphological data obtained through transmission electron microscopy. Extracted soil virus communities were dominated by bacteriophages that demonstrated a wide range of capsid diameters (20 nm to 160 nm) and morphologies, including filamentous forms and phages with elongated capsids. The reciprocal Simpson's index suggests that forest soils harbor more diverse assemblages of viruses, particularly in terms of morphological distribution. Repeated extractions of virus-like particles (VLPs) from soils indicated that the initial round of extraction removes approximately 70\% of extractable viruses. Higher VLP abundances were observed in forest soils (1.31 × 10

In this study, we analyzed ≈28 terabases of Global Ocean RNA sequences to expand Earth’s RNA virus catalogs and their taxonomy, investigate their evolutionary origins, and assess their marine biogeography from pole to pole. Using new approaches to optimize discovery and classification, we identified RNA viruses that necessitate substantive revisions of taxonomy (doubling phyla and adding {\textgreater}50\% new classes) and evolutionary understanding. “Species”-rank abundance determination revealed that viruses of the new phyla “

This is not just a numbers game; the authors also found a missing link in RNA virus evolution and discovered new phyla that dominate in the oceans and might infect mitochondria. These viruses require an ancient enzyme, RNA-directed RNA polymerase (RdRp) for replication, which is thus used as a marker of deep evolutionary relationships. In addition to the primary sequence data, information on the three-dimensional structures of the RdRp, network-based clusters, other genomic domains, and whole-genome characteristics help reshape the outlines of the evolutionary history of RNA viruses. —CA

              genes in mice provided evidence for their absolute requirement for placenta development and embryo survival, via formation by cell–cell fusion of syncytial cell layers at the fetal–maternal interface. These genes of exogenous origin, acquired ‘by chance’ and yet still ‘necessary’ to carry out a basic function in placental mammals, may have been pivotal in the emergence of mammalian ancestors with a placenta from egg-laying animals via the capture of a founding retroviral

	abstract = {Retroviruses evolved from long terminal repeat (LTR) retrotransposons by acquisition of envelope functions, and subsequently reinvaded host genomes. Together, endogenous retroviruses and LTR retrotransposons represent major components of animal, plant, and fungal genomes. Sequences from these elements have been exapted to perform essential host functions, including placental development, synaptic communication, and transcriptional regulation. They encode a Gag polypeptide, the capsid domains of which can oligomerize to form a virus-like particle. The structures of retroviral capsids have been extensively described. They assemble an immature viral particle through oligomerization of full-length Gag. Proteolytic cleavage of Gag results in a mature, infectious particle. In contrast, the absence of structural data on LTR retrotransposon capsids hinders our understanding of their function and evolutionary relationships. Here, we report the capsid morphology and structure of the archetypal Gypsy retrotransposon Ty3. We performed electron tomography (ET) of immature and mature Ty3 particles within cells. We found that, in contrast to retroviruses, these do not change size or shape upon maturation. Cryo-ET and cryo-electron microscopy of purified, immature Ty3 particles revealed an irregular fullerene geometry previously described for mature retrovirus core particles and a tertiary and quaternary arrangement of the capsid (CA) C-terminal domain within the assembled capsid that is conserved with mature HIV-1. These findings provide a structural basis for studying retrotransposon capsids, including those domesticated in higher organisms. They suggest that assembly via a structurally distinct immature capsid is a later retroviral adaptation, while the structure of mature assembled capsids is conserved between LTR retrotransposons and retroviruses.},

The origins of HIV-1 and HIV-2 have been traced to cross-species transmissions from chimpanzees and sooty mangabey monkeys respectively. Two approaches have been taken to estimate the time-scale of the evolution of these viruses. Certain groups of SIV strains appear to have evolved in a host-dependent manner, implying a time-scale of many thousands or even millions of years. In stark contrast, molecular clock calculations have previously been used to estimate a time-scale of only tens or hundreds of years. Those calculations largely ignored heterogeneity of evolutionary rates across different sites within sequences. In fact, the distribution of rates at different sites seems extremely skewed in HIV-1, and so the time-depth of the primate lentivirus evolutionary tree may have been underestimated by at least a factor of ten. However, these date estimates still seem to be far too recent to be consistent with host-dependent evolution.},

Here we report the discovery and characterization of retroviral sequences belonging to a new lentiviral subgroup from the European rabbit (
              Oryctolagus cuniculus

Despite being ancient, this subgroup contains many of the features found in present-day lentiviruses, such as the presence of
              tat and
              rev genes, thus also indicating an ancient origin for the complex regulation of lentivirus gene expression. Although the virus we describe is defective, reconstruction of an infectious progenitor could provide novel insights into lentivirus biology and host interactions.},

In this study, we conducted a comprehensive in silico screening of a large data set of available mammalian genomes for EVEs deriving from members of the viral family Flaviviridae, an important group of viruses including well-known human pathogens, such as Zika, dengue, or hepatitis C viruses. We identified two novel pestivirus-like EVEs in the reference genome of the Indochinese shrew (Crocidura indochinensis). Homologs of these novel EVEs were subsequently detected in vivo by molecular detection and sequencing in 27 shrew species, including 26 species representing a wide distribution within the Crocidurinae subfamily and one in the Soricinae subfamily on different continents. Based on this wide distribution, we estimate that the integration event occurred before the last common ancestor of the subfamily, about 10.8 million years ago, attesting to an ancient origin of pestiviruses and Flaviviridae in general. Moreover, we provide the first description of Flaviviridae-derived EVEs in mammals even though the family encompasses numerous mammal-infecting members. This also suggests that shrews were past and perhaps also current natural reservoirs of pestiviruses.

            Flavivirids (family Flaviviridae) are a group of positive-strand ribonucleic acid (RNA) viruses that pose serious risks to human and animal health on a global scale. Here, we use flavivirid-derived deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) sequences, identified in animal genomes, to reconstruct the long-term evolutionary history of family Flaviviridae. We demonstrate that flavivirids are \&gt;100 million years old and show that this timing can be combined with dates inferred from co-phyletic analysis to produce a cohesive overview of their evolution, distribution, and diversity wherein the main flavivirid subgroups originate in early animals and broadly co-diverge with major animal phyla. In addition, we reveal evidence that the ‘classical flaviviruses’ of vertebrates, most of which are transmitted via blood-feeding arthropod vectors, originally evolved in haematophagous arachnids and later acquired the capacity to be transmitted by insects. Our findings imply that the biological properties of flavivirids have been acquired gradually over the course of animal evolution. Thus, broad-scale comparative analysis will likely reveal fundamental insights into their biology. We therefore published our results via an open, extensible, database (Flavivirid-GLUE), which we constructed to facilitate the wider utilisation of genomic data and evolution-related domain knowledge in flavivirid research.},

              Parvoviruses infect humans and a broad range of animals, from mammals to crustaceans, and generally are associated with a variety of acute and chronic diseases. However, many others cause persistent infections and are not known to be associated with any disease. Viral persistence is likely related to the ability to integrate into the chromosomal DNA and to establish a latent infection. However, there is little evidence for genome integration of parvoviral DNA except for
              Adeno-associated virus
              (AAV). Here we performed a systematic search for homologs of parvoviral proteins in publicly available eukaryotic genome databases followed by experimental verification and phylogenetic analysis. We conclude that parvoviruses have frequently invaded the germ lines of diverse animal species, including mammals, fishes, birds, tunicates, arthropods, and flatworms. The identification of orthologous endogenous parvovirus sequences in the genomes of humans and other mammals suggests that parvoviruses have coexisted with mammals for at least 98 million years. Furthermore, some of the endogenized parvoviral genes were expressed in eukaryotic organisms, suggesting that these viral genes are also functional in the host genomes. Our findings may provide novel insights into parvovirus biology, host interactions, and evolution.},

            Endogenous viral elements (EVEs), derived from all major types of viruses, have been discovered in many eukaryotic genomes, representing “fossil records” of past viral infections. The endogenization of nudiviruses has been reported in several insects, leading to the question of whether genomic integration is a common phenomenon for these viruses. In this study, genomic assemblies of insects and other arthropods were analyzed to identify endogenous sequences related to Nudiviridae. A total of 359 nudivirus-like genes were identified in 43 species belonging to different groups; however, none of these genes were detected in the known hosts of nudiviruses. A large proportion of the putative EVEs identified in this study encode intact open reading frames or are transcribed as mRNAs, suggesting that they result from recent endogenization of nudiviruses. Phylogenetic analyses of the identified EVEs and inspections of their flanking regions indicated that integration of nudiviruses has occurred recurrently during the evolution of arthropods. This is the first report of a comprehensive screening for nudivirus-derived EVEs in arthropod genomes. The results of this study demonstrated that a large variety of arthropods, especially hemipteran and hymenopteran insects, have previously been or are still infected by nudiviruses. These findings have greatly extended the host range of Nudiviridae and provide new insights into viral diversity, evolution, and host–virus interactions.},

            Horizontal gene transfer commonly occurs from cells to viruses but rarely occurs from viruses to their host cells, with the exception of retroviruses and some DNA viruses. However, extensive sequence similarity searches in public genome databases for various organisms showed that the capsid protein and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase genes from totiviruses and partitiviruses have widespread homologs in the nuclear genomes of eukaryotic organisms, including plants, arthropods, fungi, nematodes, and protozoa. PCR amplification and sequencing as well as comparative evidence of junction coverage between virus and host sequences support the conclusion that these viral homologs are real and occur in eukaryotic genomes. Sequence comparison and phylogenetic analysis suggest that these genes were likely transferred horizontally from viruses to eukaryotic genomes. Furthermore, we present evidence showing that some of the transferred genes are conserved and expressed in eukaryotic organisms and suggesting that these viral genes are also functional in the recipient genomes. Our findings imply that horizontal transfer of double-stranded RNA viral genes is widespread among eukaryotes and may give rise to functionally important new genes, thus entailing that RNA viruses may play significant roles in the evolution of eukaryotes.},

              genes from 21 mice representative of the major taxonomic groups of

              Fv1
              has had antiviral function for 7 million years of evolution. First, 2 species of African pygmy mice (subgenus
              Nannomys
              ) show an
              Fv1
              -like MLV resistance, and transduced cells expressing the
              Nannomys Fv1
              gene reproduce this resistance pattern. Second, sequence comparisons suggest that
              Fv1
              has been involved in genetic conflicts throughout
              Mus
              evolution. We found evidence for strong positive selection of
              Fv1
              and identified 6 codons that show evidence of positive selection: 3 codons in the C-terminal region including 2 previously shown to contribute to
              Fv1
              restriction in laboratory mice, and 3 codons in a 10-codon segment overlapping the major homology region of
              Fv1
              ; this segment is known to be involved in capsid multimerization. This analysis suggests that
              Fv1
              has had an antiviral role throughout
              Mus
              evolution predating exposure of mice to the MLVs restricted by laboratory mouse
              Fv1

              Ichnovirus
              genera, originated from the integration of unrelated viruses in the genomes of two parasitoid wasp lineages, in a remarkable example of convergent evolution. Functionally active PDVs represent the most compelling evolutionary success among endogenous viral elements (EVEs). BV evolved from the domestication by braconid wasps of a nudivirus 100 Ma. The nudivirus genome has become an EVE involved in BV particle production but is not encapsidated. Instead, BV genomes have co-opted virulence genes, used by the wasps to control the immunity and development of their hosts. Gene transfers and duplications have shaped BV genomes, now encoding hundreds of genes. Phylogenomic studies suggest that BVs contribute largely to wasp diversification and adaptation to their hosts. A genome evolution model explains how multidirectional wasp adaptation to different host species could have fostered PDV genome extension. Integrative studies linking ecological data on the wasp to genomic analyses should provide new insights into the adaptive role of particular BV genes. Forthcoming genomic advances should also indicate if the associations between endoparasitoid wasps and symbiotic viruses evolved because of their particularly intimate interactions with their hosts, or if similar domesticated EVEs could be uncovered in other parasites.},

              Retroviral envelope gene capture and exaptation for a placental function has been demonstrated in mammals. Remarkably, placental structures have also emerged on rare occasions in nonmammalian vertebrates, resulting in related modes of reproduction. The
              Mabuya
              lizard, which emerged 25 Mya, possesses a placenta closely related to that of mammals. Here, we identified a specific retroviral envelope gene capture that shows all the characteristic features of a bona fide mammalian syncytin, being conserved in
              Mabuya
              evolution, expressed in the placenta, and fusogenic. Together with the present identification of its cognate receptor, these results show that syncytin capture is not restricted to mammals and is likely to be a major driving force for placenta emergence.
            
          , 
            
              Syncytins are envelope genes from endogenous retroviruses that have been captured during evolution for a function in placentation. They have been found in all placental mammals in which they have been searched, including marsupials. Placental structures are not restricted to mammals but also emerged in some other vertebrates, most frequently in lizards, such as the viviparous
              Mabuya
              Scincidae. Here, we performed high-throughput RNA sequencing of a
              Mabuya
              placenta transcriptome and screened for the presence of retroviral
              env
              genes with a full-length ORF. We identified one such gene, which we named “
              syncytin-Mab1
              ,” that has all the characteristics expected for a syncytin gene. It encodes a membrane-bound envelope protein with fusogenic activity ex vivo, is expressed at the placental level as revealed by in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry, and is conserved in all
              Mabuya
              species tested, spanning over 25 My of evolution. Its cognate receptor, required for its fusogenic activity, was searched for by a screening assay using the GeneBridge4 human/Chinese hamster radiation hybrid panel and found to be the MPZL1 gene, previously identified in mammals as a signal-transducing transmembrane protein involved in cell migration. Together, these results show that syncytin capture is not restricted to placental mammals, but can also take place in the rare nonmammalian vertebrates in which a viviparous placentotrophic mode of reproduction emerged. It suggests that similar molecular tools have been used for the convergent evolution of placentation in independently evolved and highly distant vertebrates.},

	abstract = {Although arthropods are important viral vectors, the biodiversity of arthropod viruses, as well as the role that arthropods have played in viral origins and evolution, is unclear. Through RNA sequencing of 70 arthropod species we discovered 112 novel viruses that appear to be ancestral to much of the documented genetic diversity of negative-sense RNA viruses, a number of which are also present as endogenous genomic copies. With this greatly enriched diversity we revealed that arthropods contain viruses that fall basal to major virus groups, including the vertebrate-specific arenaviruses, filoviruses, hantaviruses, influenza viruses, lyssaviruses, and paramyxoviruses. We similarly documented a remarkable diversity of genome structures in arthropod viruses, including a putative circular form, that sheds new light on the evolution of genome organization. Hence, arthropods are a major reservoir of viral genetic diversity and have likely been central to viral evolution.
          , 
            Many illnesses, including influenza, hemorrhagic fever, and rabies, are caused by a group of viruses called negative-sense RNA viruses. The genetic information—or genome—of these viruses is encoded in strands of RNA that must be copied before they can be translated into the proteins needed to build new viruses. It is currently known that there are at least eight different families of these viruses, which have a wide range of shapes and sizes and arrange their RNA in different ways.
            Insects, spiders, and other arthropods carry many different RNA viruses. Many of these viruses have not previously been studied, and those that have been studied so far are mainly those that cause diseases in humans and other vertebrates. Researchers therefore only know a limited amount about the diversity of the negative-sense RNA viruses that arthropods harbor and how these viruses evolved. Studying how viruses evolve helps scientists to understand what makes some viruses deadly and others harmless and can also help develop treatments or vaccines for the diseases caused by the viruses.
            Li, Shi, Tian, Lin, Kang et al. collected 70 species of insects, spiders, centipedes, and other arthropods in China and sequenced all the negative-sense RNA viruses in the creatures. This revealed an enormous number of negative-sense RNA viruses, including 112 new viruses. Many of the newly discovered arthropod viruses appear to be the ancestors of disease-causing viruses, including influenza viruses and the filoviruses—the group that includes the Ebola virus. Indeed, it appears that arthropods host many—if not all—of the negative-sense RNA viruses that cause disease in vertebrates and plants.
            While documenting the new RNA viruses and how they are related to each other, Li et al. found many different genome structures. Some genomes were segmented, which may play an important role in evolution as segments can be easily swapped to create new genetic combinations. Non-segmented and circular genomes were also found. This genetic diversity suggests that arthropods are likely to have played a key role in the evolution of new viruses by acting as a site where many different viruses can interact and exchange genetic information.},

            ABSTRACT
            
              Increasing data indicate that insects serve as major reservoirs and vectors of viruses, which account for the continuously increasing ecological burden and infectious disease outbreaks. Uncovering the hidden diversity of viruses in insects will further the understanding of the ecological and evolutionary perspectives in the emergence of insect-associated virus diseases. In this study, we queried transcriptome sequencing (RNA-Seq) data from more than 600 species across 32 insect orders dwelling in different ecological habitats and recovered more than 1,213 RNA viruses that were recapitulated in 40 families, 2 unclassified genera, and many unspecified viral groups. These novel viruses included the well-known insect-associated viruses within
              Flaviviridae
              ,
              Picornavirales
              ,
              Bunyavirales
              ,
              Mononegavirales
              ,
              Nidovirales
              ,
              Reoviridae
              , and
              Negevirus
              . More appeared to form novel clusters within previously described taxa or could be resolved as paraphyletic, including the first astrovirus identified in insects, in which many were sufficiently divergent to warrant the establishment of new virus genera or families. Additionally, some viruses were closely related to the recognized plant-, fungus-, and vertebrate-specific species, implying the importance of relationships between insect behavior and virus spread. Comparative genome analyses also revealed high genomic variability with respect to the flexible gene pool and genome architecture of these newly described viruses, including the evidence for genome reshuffling first discovered in
              Dicistroviridae
              . The data reflecting the genetically and ecologically diverse viral populations in insects greatly expand our understanding of RNA viruses in nature and highlight that the biodiversity of RNA viruses remains largely unexplored.

RNAi not only protects against viruses by degrading viral RNA, but hosts and viruses can also use RNAi to manipulate each other's gene expression, and hosts can encode microRNAs that target viral sequences. In response, viruses have evolved a myriad of adaptations to suppress and evade RNAi. RNAi can also protect cells against TEs, both by degrading TE transcripts and by preventing TE expression through heterochromatin formation. The aim of our review is to summarize and evaluate the current data on the evolution of these RNAi defence mechanisms. To this end, we also extend a previous analysis of the evolution of genes of the RNAi pathways. Strikingly, we find that antiviral RNAi genes, anti-TE RNAi genes and viral suppressors of RNAi all evolve rapidly, suggestive of an evolutionary arms race between hosts and parasites. Over longer time scales, key RNAi genes are repeatedly duplicated or lost across the metazoan phylogeny, with important implications for RNAi as an immune defence.},

              Endogenous viral elements derived from nonretroviral RNA viruses have been described in various animal genomes. Whether they have a biological function, such as host immune protection against related viruses, is a field of intense study. Here, we investigated the repertoire of endogenous flaviviral elements (EFVEs) in
              Aedes
              mosquitoes, the vectors of arboviruses such as dengue and chikungunya viruses. Previous studies identified three EFVEs from
              Aedes albopictus
              cell lines and one from
              Aedes aegypti
              cell lines. However, an in-depth characterization of EFVEs in wild-type mosquito populations and individual mosquitoes
              in vivo
              has not been performed. We detected the full-length DNA sequence of the previously described EFVEs and their respective transcripts in several
              A. albopictus
              and
              A. aegypti
              populations from geographically distinct areas. However, EFVE-derived proteins were not detected by mass spectrometry. Using deep sequencing, we detected the production of PIWI-interacting RNA-like small RNAs, in an antisense orientation, targeting the EFVEs and their flanking regions
              in vivo
              . The EFVEs were integrated in repetitive regions of the mosquito genomes, and their flanking sequences varied among mosquito populations. We bioinformatically predicted several new EFVEs from a Vietnamese
              A. albopictus
              population and observed variation in the occurrence of those elements among mosquitoes. Phylogenetic analysis of an
              A. aegypti
              EFVE suggested that it integrated prior to the global expansion of the species and subsequently diverged among and within populations. The findings of this study together reveal the substantial structural and nucleotide diversity of flaviviral integrations in
              Aedes
              genomes. Unraveling this diversity will help to elucidate the potential biological function of these EFVEs.
            
            
              IMPORTANCE
              Endogenous viral elements (EVEs) are whole or partial viral sequences integrated in host genomes. Interestingly, some EVEs have important functions for host fitness and antiviral defense. Because mosquitoes also have EVEs in their genomes, characterizing these EVEs is a prerequisite for their potential use to manipulate the mosquito antiviral response. In the study described here, we focused on EVEs related to the
              Flavivirus
              genus, to which dengue and Zika viruses belong, in individual
              Aedes
              mosquitoes from geographically distinct areas. We show the existence
              in vivo
              of flaviviral EVEs previously identified in mosquito cell lines, and we detected new ones. We show that EVEs have evolved differently in each mosquito population.

              Dysaphis plantaginea

Virus-free clones of the rosy apple aphid, or clones infected singly with an RNA virus, rosy apple aphid virus (RAAV), did not produce the winged morph in response to crowding and poor plant quality. DplDNV infection results in a significant reduction in aphid reproduction rate, but such aphids can produce the winged morph, even at low insect density, which can fly and colonize neighboring plants. Aphids infected with DplDNV produce a proportion of virus-free aphids, which enables production of virus-free clonal lines after colonization of a new plant. Our data suggest that a mutualistic relationship exists between the rosy apple aphid and its viruses. Despite the negative impact of DplDNV on rosy apple aphid reproduction, this virus contributes to their survival by inducing wing development and promoting dispersal.},

              Drosophila sechellia
              is a species restricted to the Seychelles islands, where it specializes on the fruit
              Morinda citrifolia
              (noni). This fruit is known to be toxic to closely related
              Drosophila
              species, including
              D. melanogaster
              and
              D. simulans
              , releasing
              D. sechellia
              from interspecific competition when breeding on this substrate. Previously, we showed that larvae of
              D. sechellia
              are unable to mount an effective immunological response against wasp attack, while larvae of closely-related species can defend themselves from parasitoid attack by melanotic encapsulation. We hypothesized that this inability constitutes a trait loss due to a reduced risk of parasitoid attack in noni. Here we present a lab experiment and field survey aimed to test the hypothesis that specialization on noni has released
              D. sechellia
              from the antagonistic interaction with its larval parasitoids. Our results from the lab experiment suggest that noni may be harmful to parasitoid wasps. Our results from the field survey indicate that
              D. sechellia
              was found in ripe noni, whereas another
              Drosophila
              species,
              D. malerkotliana
              , was present in unripe and overripe stages. Parasitic wasps of the species
              Leptopilina boulardi
              emerged from overripe noni, where
              D. malerkotliana
              was the most abundant host, but not from ripe noni. These results indicate that the specialization of
              D. sechellia
              on noni has indeed drastically altered its ecological interactions, leading to a relaxation in the selection pressure to maintain parasitoid resistance.},

As resistance to chemical pesticides continues to escalate in many pest populations, attention is now refocusing on biologically based strategies to control pest species in agriculture and forestry as well as insect vector populations that transmit human and animal diseases. Parasitoids are an economically critical element in this equation and in integrated pest management. Viruses have evolved intimate associations with parasitoids, and this book features a large section on symbiotic viruses that are integrated into the wasp chromosomal DNA (polydnaviruses).

              The relationship between parasitoid wasps and polydnaviruses constitutes one of the few known mutualisms between viruses and eukaryotes. Viral particles are injected with the wasp eggs into parasitized larvae, and the viral genes thus introduced are used to manipulate lepidopteran host physiology. The genome packaged in the particles is composed of 35 double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) circles produced in wasp ovaries by amplification of viral sequences from proviral segments integrated in tandem arrays in the wasp genome. These segments and their flanking regions within the genome of the wasp
              Cotesia congregata
              were recently isolated, allowing extensive mapping of amplified sequences. The bracovirus DNAs packaged in the particles were found to be amplified within more than 12 replication units. Strikingly, the nudiviral cluster, the genes of which encode particle structural components, was also amplified, although not encapsidated. Amplification of bracoviral sequences was shown to involve successive head-to-head and tail-to-tail concatemers, which was not expected given the nudiviral origin of bracoviruses.},

            Background
            
              The beet armyworm,
              Spodoptera exigua
              (Hübner), is a worldwide, polyphagous agricultural pest feeding on vegetable, field, and flower crops. However, the lack of genome information on this insect severely limits our understanding of its rapid adaptation and hampers the development of efficient pest management strategies.
            
          
          
            Findings
            We report a chromosome-level genome assembly using single-molecule real-time PacBio sequencing and Hi-C data. The final genome assembly was 446.80 Mb with a scaffold N50 of 14.36 Mb, and captured 97.9\% complete arthropod Benchmarking Universal Single-Copy Orthologs (BUSCO, n=1,658). A total of 367 contigs were anchored to 32 pseudo-chromosomes, covering 96.18\% (429.74 Mb) of the total genome length. We predicted 17,727 protein-coding genes, of which 81.60\% were supported by transcriptome evidence and 96.47\% matched UniProt protein records. We also identified 867,102 (147.97 Mb/33.12\%) repetitive elements and 1,609 noncoding RNAs. Synteny inference indicated a conserved collinearity between three lepidopteran species. Gene family evolution and function enrichment analyses showed the significant expansions in families related to development, dietary, detoxification and chemosensory system, indicating these families may play a role in host plant specialization and niche adaptation.
          
          
            Conclusions
            We have generated a high-quality chromosomal-level genome that could provide a valuable resource for a better understanding and management of the beet armyworm.},

              Endogenous viruses form an important proportion of eukaryote genomes and a source of novel functions. How large DNA viruses integrated into a genome evolve when they confer a benefit to their host, however, remains unknown. Bracoviruses are essential for the parasitism success of parasitoid wasps, into whose genomes they integrated {\textasciitilde}103 million years ago. Here we show, from the assembly of a parasitoid wasp genome at a chromosomal scale, that bracovirus genes colonized all ten chromosomes of
              Cotesia congregata

              , revealed that these clusters were already established {\textasciitilde}53 mya and thus belong to remarkably stable genomic structures, the architectures of which are evolutionary constrained. Transcriptomic analyses highlight temporal synchronization of viral gene expression without resulting in immune gene induction, suggesting that no conflicts remain between ancient symbiotic partners when benefits to them converge.},

              Background
              Gene duplications have been proposed to be the main mechanism involved in genome evolution and in acquisition of new functions. Polydnaviruses (PDVs), symbiotic viruses associated with parasitoid wasps, are ideal model systems to study mechanisms of gene duplications given that PDV genomes consist of virulence genes organized into multigene families. In these systems the viral genome is integrated in a wasp chromosome as a provirus and virus particles containing circular double-stranded DNA are injected into the parasitoids’ hosts and are essential for parasitism success. The viral virulence factors, organized in gene families, are required collectively to induce host immune suppression and developmental arrest. The gene family which encodes protein tyrosine phosphatases (PTPs) has undergone spectacular expansion in several PDV genomes with up to 42 genes.
            
            
              Results
              Here, we present strong indications that PTP gene family expansion occurred via classical mechanisms: by duplication of large segments of the chromosomally integrated form of the virus sequences (segmental duplication), by tandem duplications within this form and by dispersed duplications. We also propose a novel duplication mechanism specific to PDVs that involves viral circle reintegration into the wasp genome. The PTP copies produced were shown to undergo conservative evolution along with episodes of adaptive evolution. In particular recently produced copies have undergone positive selection in sites most likely involved in defining substrate selectivity.
            
            
              Conclusion
              The results provide evidence about the dynamic nature of polydnavirus proviral genomes. Classical and PDV-specific duplication mechanisms have been involved in the production of new gene copies. Selection pressures associated with antagonistic interactions with parasitized hosts have shaped these genes used to manipulate lepidopteran physiology with evidence for positive selection involved in adaptation to host targets.},

            ABSTRACT
            
              Bracoviruses are domesticated viruses found in parasitic wasp genomes. They are composed of genes of nudiviral origin that are involved in particle production and proviral segments containing virulence genes that are necessary for parasitism success. During particle production, proviral segments are amplified and individually packaged as DNA circles in nucleocapsids. These particles are injected by parasitic wasps into host larvae together with their eggs. Bracovirus circles of two wasp species were reported to undergo chromosomal integration in parasitized host hemocytes, through a conserved sequence named the host integration motif (HIM). Here, we used bulk Illumina sequencing to survey integrations of
              Cotesia typhae
              bracovirus circles in the DNA of its host, the maize corn borer (
              Sesamia nonagrioides
              ), 7 days after parasitism. First, assembly and annotation of a high-quality genome for
              C. typhae
              enabled us to characterize 27 proviral segments clustered in proviral loci. Using these data, we characterized large numbers of chromosomal integrations (from 12 to 85 events per host haploid genome) for all 16 bracovirus circles containing a HIM. Integrations were found in four
              S. nonagrioides
              tissues and in the body of a caterpillar in which parasitism had failed. The 12 remaining circles do not integrate but are maintained at high levels in host tissues. Surprisingly, we found that HIM-mediated chromosomal integration in the wasp germ line has occurred accidentally at least six times during evolution. Overall, our study furthers our understanding of wasp-host genome interactions and supports HIM-mediated chromosomal integration as a possible mechanism of horizontal transfer from wasps to their hosts.
            
            
              IMPORTANCE
              Bracoviruses are endogenous domesticated viruses of parasitoid wasps that are injected together with wasp eggs into wasp host larvae during parasitism. Several studies have shown that some DNA circles packaged into bracovirus particles become integrated into host somatic genomes during parasitism, but the phenomenon has never been studied using nontargeted approaches. Here, we use bulk Illumina sequencing to systematically characterize and quantify bracovirus circle integrations that occur in four tissues of the Mediterranean corn borer (
              Sesamia nonagrioides
              ) during parasitism by the
              Cotesia typhae
              wasp. Our analysis reveals that all circles containing a HIM integrate at substantial levels (from 12 to 85 integrations per host cell, in total) in all tissues, while other circles do not integrate. In addition to shedding new light on wasp-bracovirus-host interactions, our study supports HIM-mediated chromosomal integration of bracovirus as a possible source of wasp-to-host horizontal transfer, with long-term evolutionary consequences.},

            Increasing numbers of horizontal transfer (HT) of genes and transposable elements are reported in insects. Yet the mechanisms underlying these transfers remain unknown. Here we firs t quantify and characterize the patterns of chromosomal integration of the polydnavirus (PDV) encoded by the Campopleginae
            Hyposoter didymator
            parasitoid wasp (HdIV) in somatic cells of parasitized fall armyworm (
            Spodoptera frugiperda
            ). Polydnaviruses are domesticated viruses injected by wasps together with their eggs into their hosts in order to facilitate the development of wasp larvae. We found that six HdIV DNA circles integrate into the genome of host somatic cells. Each host haploid genome suffers between 23 and 40 integration events (IEs) on average 72 hours post parasitism. Almost all IEs are mediated by DNA double strand breaks occurring in the host integration motif (HIM) of HdIV circles. We show that despite their independent evolutionary origins, PDV from both Campopleginae and Braconidae wasps use remarkably similar mechanisms for chromosomal integration. Next, our similarity search performed on 775 genomes reveals that PDVs of both Campopleginae and Braconidae wasps have recurrently colonized the germline of dozens of lepidopteran species through the same mechanisms they use to integrate into somatic host chromosomes during parasitism. We found evidence of HIM-mediated HT of PDV DNA circles in no less than 124 species belonging to 15 lepidopteran families. Thus, this mechanism underlies a major route of HT of genetic material from wasps to lepidopterans with likely important consequences on lepidopterans.},

              Five highly conserved

              infectivity factors, PIF1, PIF2, PIF3, PIF4, and P74, have been reported to be essential for oral infectivity of baculovirus occlusion-derived virus (ODV) in insect larvae. Three of these proteins, P74, PIF1, and PIF2, were thought to function in virus binding to insect midgut cells. In this paper evidence is provided that PIF1, PIF2, and PIF3 form a stable complex on the surface of ODV particles of the baculovirus
              Autographa californica
              multinucleocapsid nucleopolyhedrovirus (AcMNPV). The complex could withstand 2\% SDS-5\% β-mercaptoethanol with heating at 50°C for 5 min. The complex was not formed when any of the genes for PIF1, PIF2, or PIF3 was deleted, while reinsertion of these genes into AcMNPV restored the complex. Coimmunoprecipitation analysis independently confirmed the interactions of the three PIF proteins and revealed in addition that P74 is also associated with this complex. However, deletion of the
              p74
              gene did not affect formation of the PIF1-PIF2-PIF3 complex. Electron microscopy analysis showed that PIF1 and PIF2 are localized on the surface of the ODV with a scattered distribution. This distribution did not change for PIF1 or PIF2 when the gene for PIF2 or PIF1 protein was deleted. We propose that PIF1, PIF2, PIF3, and P74 form an evolutionarily conserved complex on the ODV surface, which has an essential function in the initial stages of baculovirus oral infection.},

              Polydnaviruses (PDVs) are symbionts of parasitoid wasps that function as gene delivery vehicles in the insects (hosts) that the wasps parasitize. PDVs persist in wasps as integrated proviruses but are packaged as circularized and segmented double-stranded DNAs into the virions that wasps inject into hosts. In contrast, little is known about how PDV genomic DNAs persist in host cells.
              Microplitis demolitor
              carries
              Microplitis demolitor
              bracovirus (MdBV) and parasitizes the host
              Pseudoplusia includens
              . MdBV infects primarily host hemocytes and also infects a hemocyte-derived cell line from
              P. includens
              called CiE1 cells. Here we report that all 15 genomic segments of the MdBV encapsidated genome exhibited long-term persistence in CiE1 cells. Most MdBV genes expressed in hemocytes were persistently expressed in CiE1 cells, including members of the
              glc
              gene family whose products transformed CiE1 cells into a suspension culture. PCR-based integration assays combined with cloning and sequencing of host-virus junctions confirmed that genomic segments J and C persisted in CiE1 cells by integration. These genomic DNAs also rapidly integrated into parasitized
              P. includens
              . Sequence analysis of wasp-viral junction clones showed that the integration of proviral segments in
              M. demolitor
              was associated with a wasp excision/integration motif (WIM) known from other bracoviruses. However, integration into host cells occurred in association with a previously unknown domain that we named the host integration motif (HIM). The presence of HIMs in most MdBV genomic DNAs suggests that the integration of each genomic segment into host cells occurs through a shared mechanism.},

The Polydnaviridae are of particular interest because these viruses are all obligate mutualists of insects called parasitoid wasps. Parasitoids develop during their immature stages by feeding inside the body of other insects, which serve as their hosts. Polydnaviruses are vertically transmitted as proviruses through the germ line of wasps but also function as gene delivery vectors that wasps rely upon to genetically manipulate the hosts they parasitize. Here we review the evolutionary origin of polydnaviruses, the organization and function of their genomes, and some of their roles in parasitism.},

              Bracoviruses (BVs) from the
              Polydnaviridae
              family are symbiotic viruses used as biological weapons by parasitoid wasps to manipulate lepidopteran host physiology and induce parasitism success. BV particles are produced by wasp ovaries and injected along with the eggs into the caterpillar host body, where viral gene expression is necessary for wasp development. Recent sequencing of the proviral genome of
              Cotesia congregata
              BV (CcBV) identified 222 predicted virulence genes present on 35 proviral segments integrated into the wasp genome. To date, the expressions of only a few selected candidate virulence genes have been studied in the caterpillar host, and we lacked a global vision of viral gene expression. In this study, a large-scale transcriptomic analysis by 454 sequencing of two immune tissues (fat body and hemocytes) of parasitized
              Manduca sexta
              caterpillar hosts allowed the detection of expression of 88 CcBV genes expressed 24 h after the onset of parasitism. We linked the expression profiles of these genes to several factors, showing that different regulatory mechanisms control viral gene expression in the host. These factors include the presence of signal peptides in encoded proteins, diversification of promoter regions, and, more surprisingly, gene position on the proviral genome. Indeed, most genes for which expression could be detected are localized in particular proviral regions globally producing higher numbers of circles. Moreover, this polydnavirus (PDV) transcriptomic analysis also reveals that a majority of CcBV genes possess at least one intron and an arthropod transcription start site, consistent with an insect origin of these virulence genes.
            
            
              IMPORTANCE
              Bracoviruses (BVs) are symbiotic polydnaviruses used by parasitoid wasps to manipulate lepidopteran host physiology, ensuring wasp offspring survival. To date, the expressions of only a few selected candidate BV virulence genes have been studied in caterpillar hosts. We performed a large-scale analysis of BV gene expression in two immune tissues of
              Manduca sexta
              caterpillars parasitized by
              Cotesia congregata
              wasps. Genes for which expression could be detected corresponded to genes localized in particular regions of the viral genome globally producing higher numbers of circles. Our study thus brings an original global vision of viral gene expression and paves the way to the determination of the regulatory mechanisms enabling the expression of BV genes in targeted organisms, such as major insect pests. In addition, we identify sequence features suggesting that most BV virulence genes were acquired from insect genomes.},

              M. demolitor
              produces a protein, Egf1.0, which inhibits the phenoloxidase (PO) cascade. Egf1.0 belongs to a larger gene family that shares a cysteine-rich motif with similarities to the trypsin inhibitor-like (TIL) domains of small serine proteinase inhibitors (smapins). Gain-of-function and RNAi experiments indicated that the Egf genes are the only MdBV-encoded factors responsible for disabling the insect melanization response. Known smapins bind target proteinases in a substrate-like fashion and are cleaved at a single reactive site bond. The P1–P1′ position for Egf1.0 has the sequence Arg-Phe, which suggested that its target proteinase is a prophenoloxidase-activating proteinase (PAP). Wild-type Egf1.0 inhibited PAP-3 from
              Manduca sexta

              R51A
              , whose reactive-site arginine was replaced with an alanine, had no PAP-3 inhibitory activity. Other experiments using wild-type and mutant constructs indicated that Egf1.0 blocks activation of the PO cascade via PAP inhibition. Overall, our results identify a novel inhibitor of the PO cascade and indicate that suppression of the host melanization response is functionally important for both the virus and its associated wasp.},

	abstract = {Parasitoid wasps must avoid the destructive effects of the host's cellular defense system in order to exploit the host hemocoel as a suitable environment for their survival. To protect their eggs from encapsulation by Drosophila melanogaster blood cells, Leptopilina heterotoma females inject a factor that selectively destroys lamellocytes, the type of Drosophila blood cell involved in recognition and encapsulation of large foreign objects. Other types of host blood cells, including the phagocytic plasmatocytes, remain functional. This report demonstrates that the destructive factor for lamellocytes is a virus-like particle (VLP) stored in the reservoir of an accessory gland associated with the female wasp reproductive system. We show that VLPs enter Drosophila blood cells in vitro. VLPs are found free in the cytoplasm of lamellocytes but are confined to phagocytic vesicles of plasmatocytes. As lamellocytes are susceptible to the VLP infection and plasmatocytes are not, we conclude that the mode of VLP entry and its disposition in the cytoplasm determine the fate of the infected host blood cell.},

              Musca domestica
              house fly), their role as pests (
              Anopheles gambiae

A resolved phylogeny for flies provides a framework for genomic, developmental, and evolutionary studies by facilitating comparisons across model organisms, yet recent research has suggested that fly relationships have been obscured by multiple episodes of rapid diversification. We provide a phylogenomic estimate of fly relationships based on molecules and morphology from 149 of 157 families, including 30 kb from 14 nuclear loci and complete mitochondrial genomes combined with 371 morphological characters. Multiple analyses show support for traditional groups (Brachycera, Cyclorrhapha, and Schizophora) and corroborate contentious findings, such as the anomalous Deuterophlebiidae as the sister group to all remaining Diptera. Our findings reveal that the closest relatives of the Drosophilidae are highly modified parasites (including the wingless Braulidae) of bees and other insects. Furthermore, we use micro-RNAs to resolve a node with implications for the evolution of embryonic development in Diptera. We demonstrate that flies experienced three episodes of rapid radiation—lower Diptera (220 Ma), lower Brachycera (180 Ma), and Schizophora (65 Ma)—and a number of life history transitions to hematophagy, phytophagy, and parasitism in the history of fly evolution over 260 million y.},

            Many viral diseases have emerged in recent decades, but prehistoric viral infections remain poorly understood. In some cases, nucleotide sequences of ancient viruses, which infected ancestral animals, have been integrated into their genomes during evolution. Such “molecular fossil records” of viruses help researchers trace past viral infections. Here, we reconstructed the infection history of an RNA virus, the bornavirus, for approximately 100 My in vertebrate evolution, using molecular fossils of ancient bornaviruses. Our analyses using ancient bornaviral sequences from over 100 vertebrate species genomes indicated that bornaviruses infected a broader range of host lineages during their long-term evolution than expected from extant bornaviral host ranges. Our findings highlighted the hidden history of this RNA viral infection over geological timescales.
          , 
            Although viruses have threatened our ancestors for millions of years, prehistoric epidemics of viruses are largely unknown. Endogenous bornavirus-like elements (EBLs) are ancient bornavirus sequences derived from the viral messenger RNAs that were reverse transcribed and inserted into animal genomes, most likely by retrotransposons. These elements can be used as molecular fossil records to trace past bornaviral infections. In this study, we systematically identified EBLs in vertebrate genomes and revealed the history of bornavirus infections over nearly 100 My. We confirmed that ancient bornaviral infections have occurred in diverse vertebrate lineages, especially in primate ancestors. Phylogenetic analyses indicated that primate ancestors were infected with various bornaviral lineages during evolution. EBLs in primate genomes formed clades according to their integration ages, suggesting that bornavirus lineages infected with primate ancestors had changed chronologically. However, some bornaviral lineages may have coexisted with primate ancestors and underwent repeated endogenizations for tens of millions of years. Moreover, a bornaviral lineage that coexisted with primate ancestors also endogenized in the genomes of some ancestral bats. The habitats of these bat ancestors have been reported to overlap with the migration route of primate ancestors. These results suggest that long-term virus–host coexistence expanded the geographic distributions of the bornaviral lineage along with primate migration and may have spread their infections to these bat ancestors. Our findings provide insight into the history of bornavirus infections over geological timescales that cannot be deduced from research using extant viruses alone, thus broadening our perspective on virus–host coevolution.},

Although the circumstances surrounding these recent zoonoses are becoming clearer, the nature and timescale of interaction between lentiviruses and primates remains unknown. Here, we report the discovery of an endogenous lentivirus in the genome of the gray mouse lemur (
              Microcebus murinus
              ), a strepsirrhine primate from Madagascar, demonstrating that lentiviruses are capable of invading the primate germ line. Phylogenetic analysis places gray mouse lemur prosimian immunodeficiency virus (pSIVgml) basal to all known primate lentiviruses and, consistent with this, its genomic organization is intermediate between the nonprimate lentiviruses and their more derived primate counterparts. Thus, pSIVgml represents the first unambiguous example of a viral transitional form, revealing the acquisition and loss of genomic features during lentiviral evolution. Furthermore, because terrestrial mammal populations in Madagascar and Africa are likely to have been isolated from one another for at least 14 million years, the presence of pSIVgml in the gray mouse lemur genome indicates that lentiviruses must have been infecting primates for at least this period of time, or have been transmitted between Malagasy and African primate populations by a vector species capable of traversing the Mozambique channel. The discovery of pSIVgml illustrates the utility of endogenous sequences for the study of contemporary retroviruses and indicates that primate lentiviruses may be considerably older and more broadly distributed than previously thought.},

              Background
              
                Polydnaviruses (PDVs) are mutualistic endogenous viruses inoculated by some lineages of parasitoid wasps into their hosts, where they facilitate successful wasp development. PDVs include the ichnoviruses and bracoviruses that originate from independent viral acquisitions in ichneumonid and braconid wasps respectively. PDV genomes are fully incorporated into the wasp genomes and consist of (1) genes involved in viral particle production, which derive from the viral ancestor and are not encapsidated, and (2) proviral segments harboring virulence genes, which are packaged into the viral particle. To help elucidating the mechanisms that have facilitated viral domestication in ichneumonid wasps, we analyzed the structure of the viral insertions by sequencing the whole genome of two ichnovirus-carrying wasp species,
                Hyposoter didymator
                and
                Campoletis sonorensis
                .
              
            
            
              Results
              Assemblies with long scaffold sizes allowed us to unravel the organization of the endogenous ichnovirus and revealed considerable dispersion of the viral loci within the wasp genomes. Proviral segments contained species-specific sets of genes and occupied distinct genomic locations in the two ichneumonid wasps. In contrast, viral machinery genes were organized in clusters showing highly conserved gene content and order, with some loci located in collinear wasp genomic regions. This genomic architecture clearly differs from the organization of PDVs in braconid wasps, in which proviral segments are clustered and viral machinery elements are more dispersed.
            
            
              Conclusions
              The contrasting structures of the two types of ichnovirus genomic elements are consistent with their different functions: proviral segments are vehicles for virulence proteins expected to adapt according to different host defense systems, whereas the genes involved in virus particle production in the wasp are likely more stable and may reflect ancestral viral architecture. The distinct genomic architectures seen in ichnoviruses versus bracoviruses reveal different evolutionary trajectories that have led to virus domestication in the two wasp lineages.},

              Pachycrepoideus vindemmiae
              (Rondani, 1875)). The genome of the novel virus, Rondani’s wasp virus 1 (RoWV-1), contains two long open reading frames encoding a nonstructural and a structural protein, respectively, and is 3’-polyadenylated. Phylogenetic analyses firmly place RoWV-1 into the dicistrovirid genus
              Cripavirus
              . We detected RoWV-1 in various tissues and life stages of the parasitoid wasp, with the highest virus load measured in the larval digestive tract. We demonstrate that RoWV-1 is transmitted horizontally from infected to uninfected wasps but not vertically to wasp offspring. Comparison of several important biological parameters between the infected and uninfected wasps indicates that RoWV-1 does not have obvious detrimental effects on wasps. We further demonstrate that RoWV-1 also infects
              Drosophila melanogaster
              (Meigen, 1830), the hosts of the pupal ectoparasitoid wasps, and thereby increases its pupal developmental duration and fecundity, but decreases the eclosion rate. Together, these results suggest that RoWV-1 may have a potential benefit to the wasp by increasing not only the number of potential wasp hosts but also the developmental time of the hosts to ensure proper development of wasp offspring.},

            ABSTRACT
            
              For insects known as parasitoid wasps, successful development as a parasite results in the death of the host insect. As a result of this lethal interaction, wasps and their hosts have coevolved strategies to gain an advantage in this evolutionary arms race. Although normally considered to be strict pathogens, some viruses have established persistent infections within parasitoid wasp lineages and are beneficial to wasps during parasitism. Heritable associations between viruses and parasitoid wasps have evolved independently multiple times, but most of these systems remain largely understudied with respect to viral origin, transmission and replication strategies of the virus, and interactions between the virus and host insects. Here, we report a detailed characterization of Diachasmimorpha longicaudata entomopoxvirus (DlEPV), a poxvirus found within the venom gland of
              Diachasmimorpha longicaudata
              wasps. Our results show that DlEPV exhibits similar but distinct transmission and replication dynamics compared to those of other parasitoid viral elements, including vertical transmission of the virus within wasps, as well as virus replication in both female wasps and fruit fly hosts. Functional assays demonstrate that DlEPV is highly virulent within fly hosts, and wasps without DlEPV have severely reduced parasitism success compared to those with a typical viral load. Taken together, the data presented in this study illustrate a novel case of beneficial virus evolution, in which a virus of unique origin has undergone convergent evolution with other viral elements associated with parasitoid wasps to provide an analogous function throughout parasitism.
            
            
              IMPORTANCE
              Viruses are generally considered to be disease-causing agents, but several instances of beneficial viral elements have been identified in insects called parasitoid wasps. These virus-derived entities are passed on through wasp generations and enhance the success of the wasps’ parasitic life cycle. Many parasitoid-virus partnerships studied to date exhibit common features among independent cases of this phenomenon, including a mother-to-offspring route of virus transmission, a restricted time and location for virus replication, and a positive effect of virus activity on wasp survival. Our characterization of Diachasmimorpha longicaudata entomopoxvirus (DlEPV), a poxvirus found in
              Diachasmimorpha longicaudata
              parasitoid wasps, represents a novel example of beneficial virus evolution. Here, we show that DlEPV exhibits functional similarities to known parasitoid viral elements that support its comparable role during parasitism. Our results also demonstrate unique differences that suggest DlEPV is more autonomous than other long-term viral associations described in parasitoid wasps.},

	abstract = {Previous research has suggested that human herpesvirus-6 (HHV-6) may integrate into host cell chromosomes and be vertically transmitted in the germ line, but the evidence—primarily fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH)—is indirect. We sought, first, to definitively test these two hypotheses. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were isolated from families in which several members, including at least one parent and child, had unusually high copy numbers of HHV-6 DNA per milliliter of blood. FISH confirmed that HHV-6 DNA colocalized with telomeric regions of one allele on chromosomes 17p13.3, 18q23, and 22q13.3, and that the integration site was identical among members of the same family. Integration of the HHV-6 genome into TTAGGG telomere repeats was confirmed by additional methods and sequencing of the integration site. Partial sequencing of the viral genome identified the same integrated HHV-6A strain within members of families, confirming vertical transmission of the viral genome. We next asked whether HHV-6A infection of naïve cell lines could lead to integration. Following infection of naïve Jjhan and HEK-293 cell lines by HHV-6, the virus integrated into telomeres. Reactivation of integrated HHV-6A virus from individuals’ PBMCs as well as cell lines was successfully accomplished by compounds known to induce latent herpesvirus replication. Finally, no circular episomal forms were detected even by PCR. Taken together, the data suggest that HHV-6 is unique among human herpesviruses: it specifically and efficiently integrates into telomeres of chromosomes during latency rather than forming episomes, and the integrated viral genome is capable of producing virions.},

Human herpesvirus 6 (HHV-6) and oncogenic Marek's disease virus (MDV) have been shown to integrate their genomes into host telomeres of latently infected cells. This is unusual for herpesviruses as most maintain their genomes as circular episomes during the quiescent stage of infection. The genomic DNA of HHV-6, MDV, and several other herpesviruses harbors telomeric repeats (TMRs) that are identical to host telomere sequences (TTAGGG). At least in the case of MDV, viral TMRs facilitate integration into host telomeres. Integration of HHV-6 occurs not only in lymphocytes but also in the germline of some individuals, allowing vertical virus transmission. Although the molecular mechanism of telomere integration is poorly understood, the presence of TMRs in a number of herpesviruses suggests it is their default program for genome maintenance during latency and also allows efficient reactivation.},

Thus, RNA viruses should be closely scrutinized for any capacity to interact with endogenous retroviral elements before their approval for therapeutic use in humans.},

Although the circumstances surrounding these recent zoonoses are becoming clearer, the nature and timescale of interaction between lentiviruses and primates remains unknown. Here, we report the discovery of an endogenous lentivirus in the genome of the gray mouse lemur (
              Microcebus murinus
              ), a strepsirrhine primate from Madagascar, demonstrating that lentiviruses are capable of invading the primate germ line. Phylogenetic analysis places gray mouse lemur prosimian immunodeficiency virus (pSIVgml) basal to all known primate lentiviruses and, consistent with this, its genomic organization is intermediate between the nonprimate lentiviruses and their more derived primate counterparts. Thus, pSIVgml represents the first unambiguous example of a viral transitional form, revealing the acquisition and loss of genomic features during lentiviral evolution. Furthermore, because terrestrial mammal populations in Madagascar and Africa are likely to have been isolated from one another for at least 14 million years, the presence of pSIVgml in the gray mouse lemur genome indicates that lentiviruses must have been infecting primates for at least this period of time, or have been transmitted between Malagasy and African primate populations by a vector species capable of traversing the Mozambique channel. The discovery of pSIVgml illustrates the utility of endogenous sequences for the study of contemporary retroviruses and indicates that primate lentiviruses may be considerably older and more broadly distributed than previously thought.},

            ABSTRACT
            
              Bracoviruses (BVs) are endogenized nudiviruses in parasitoid wasps of the microgastroid complex (family Braconidae). Microgastroid wasps have coopted nudivirus genes to produce replication-defective virions that females use to transfer virulence genes to parasitized hosts. The microgastroid complex further consists of six subfamilies and ∼50,000 species but current understanding of BV gene inventories and organization primarily derives from analysis of two wasp species in the subfamily Microgastrinae (
              Microplitis demolitor
              and
              Cotesia congregata
              ) that produce M. demolitor BV (MdBV) and C. congregata BV (CcBV). Notably, several genomic features of MdBV and CcBV remain conserved since divergence of
              M. demolitor
              and
              C. congregata
              ∼53 million years ago (MYA). However, it is unknown whether these conserved traits more broadly reflect BV evolution, because no complete genomes exist for any microgastroid wasps outside the Microgastrinae. In this regard, the subfamily Cheloninae is of greatest interest because it diverged earliest from the Microgastrinae (∼85 MYA) after endogenization of the nudivirus ancestor. Here, we present the complete genome of
              Chelonus insularis
              , which is an egg-larval parasitoid in the Cheloninae that produces C. insularis BV (CinsBV). We report that the inventory of nudivirus genes in
              C. insularis
              is conserved but are dissimilarly organized compared to
              M. demolitor
              and
              C. congregata
              . Reciprocally, CinsBV proviral segments share organizational features with MdBV and CcBV but virulence gene inventories exhibit almost no overlap. Altogether, our results point to the functional importance of a conserved inventory of nudivirus genes and a dynamic set of virulence genes for the successful parasitism of hosts. Our results also suggest organizational features previously identified in MdBV and CcBV are likely not essential for BV virion formation.

              Bracoviruses are a remarkable example of virus endogenization, because large sets of genes from a nudivirus ancestor continue to produce virions that thousands of wasp species rely upon to parasitize hosts. Understanding how these genes interact and have been coopted by wasps for novel functions is of broad interest in the study of virus evolution. This work characterizes bracovirus genome components in the parasitoid wasp
              Chelonus insularis
              , which together with existing wasp genomes captures a large portion of the diversity among wasp species that produce bracoviruses. Results provide new information about how bracovirus genome components are organized in different wasps while also providing additional insights on key features required for function.},

            ABSTRACT
            
              Bracoviruses (BVs) are endogenized nudiviruses in parasitoid wasps of the microgastroid complex (family Braconidae). Microgastroid wasps have coopted nudivirus genes to produce replication-defective virions that females use to transfer virulence genes to parasitized hosts. The microgastroid complex further consists of six subfamilies and ∼50,000 species but current understanding of BV gene inventories and organization primarily derives from analysis of two wasp species in the subfamily Microgastrinae (
              Microplitis demolitor
              and
              Cotesia congregata
              ) that produce M. demolitor BV (MdBV) and C. congregata BV (CcBV). Notably, several genomic features of MdBV and CcBV remain conserved since divergence of
              M. demolitor
              and
              C. congregata
              ∼53 million years ago (MYA). However, it is unknown whether these conserved traits more broadly reflect BV evolution, because no complete genomes exist for any microgastroid wasps outside the Microgastrinae. In this regard, the subfamily Cheloninae is of greatest interest because it diverged earliest from the Microgastrinae (∼85 MYA) after endogenization of the nudivirus ancestor. Here, we present the complete genome of
              Chelonus insularis
              , which is an egg-larval parasitoid in the Cheloninae that produces C. insularis BV (CinsBV). We report that the inventory of nudivirus genes in
              C. insularis
              is conserved but are dissimilarly organized compared to

Altogether, our results point to the functional importance of a conserved inventory of nudivirus genes and a dynamic set of virulence genes for the successful parasitism of hosts. Our results also suggest organizational features previously identified in MdBV and CcBV are likely not essential for BV virion formation.

              For insects, the prevalence of numerous vertically transmitted viruses can be high in their host populations. These viruses often have few, if any, pathological effects on their hosts, and consequently, many of them can remain unnoticed for long periods, despite their potential role in the evolution of the host phenotype. Some females of
              Leptopilina boulardi
              , a solitary parasitoid of
              Drosophila
              larvae, are infected by an inherited virus (LbFV) that manipulates the behavior of the wasp by increasing its tendency to lay eggs in a host that is already parasitized (superparasitism). This behavioral alteration allows horizontal transmission of the virus within superparasitized
              Drosophila
              larvae. Using suppressive subtractive hybridization with infected and uninfected lines, we identified one putative viral sequence. Based on this sequence, we developed a simple PCR test. We tested the correlation between the superparasitism phenotype and PCR amplification of the putative viral marker using several experimental conditions (including horizontal transfers) and several parasitoid genotypes. All of the results revealed that there was a perfect match between the superparasitism phenotype and the amplification profile, which validated use of the molecular marker as a tool to track the presence of the virus and provided the first genomic data for this fascinating virus. The results also show that there was very efficient horizontal and vertical transmission of LbFV, which probably explains its high prevalence in the French populations that we sampled (67 and 70\% of infected females). This manipulative virus is likely to play a major role in the ecology and evolution of its parasitoid host.},

These membrane-bounded particles are produced in large numbers within the nuclei of the calyx cells and are found in vast numbers in the lumen of the calyx. Only a few have been seen in the cytoplasm of the cells, and it may be inferred that they pass quickly through the cells. They appear in the microvilli of the luminal surface, and are released when the tips of microvilli enclosing particles become pinched off. As shown in the preceding paper, they become attached to the outer layer of the chorion of eggs passing through the calyx. The first signs of particles appear to be the presence of empty membranes found in the nuclei of 17-day-old individuals, and their development has been traced through to the adult stage of the parasitoid. The unique nature of the particulate secretion is discussed.},

              Polydnaviruses are large, double-stranded DNA viruses that are beneficial symbionts of parasitoid wasps. Polydnaviruses in the genus
              Bracovirus
              (BVs) persist in wasps as proviruses, and their genomes consist of two functional components referred to as proviral segments and nudivirus-like genes. Prior studies established that the DNA domains where proviral segments reside are amplified during replication and that segments within amplified loci are circularized before packaging into nucleocapsids. One DNA domain where nudivirus-like genes are located is also amplified but never packaged into virions. We recently sequenced the genome of the braconid
              Microplitis demolitor
              , which carries
              M. demolitor
              bracovirus (MdBV). Here, we took advantage of this resource to characterize the DNAs that are amplified during MdBV replication using a combination of Illumina and Pacific Biosciences sequencing approaches. The results showed that specific nucleotide sites identify the boundaries of amplification for proviral loci. Surprisingly, however, amplification of loci 3, 4, 6, and 8 produced head-to-tail concatemeric intermediates; loci 1, 2, and 5 produced head-to-head/tail-to-tail concatemers; and locus 7 yielded no identified concatemers. Sequence differences at amplification junctions correlated with the types of amplification intermediates the loci produced, while concatemer processing gave rise to the circularized DNAs that are packaged into nucleocapsids. The MdBV nudivirus-like gene cluster was also amplified, albeit more weakly than most proviral loci and with nondiscrete boundaries. Overall, the MdBV genome exhibited three patterns of DNA amplification during replication. Our data also suggest that PacBio sequencing could be useful in studying the replication intermediates produced by other DNA viruses.
            
            
              IMPORTANCE
              Polydnaviruses are of fundamental interest because they provide a novel example of viruses evolving into beneficial symbionts. All polydnaviruses are associated with insects called parasitoid wasps, which are of additional applied interest because many are biological control agents of pest insects. Polydnaviruses in the genus
              Bracovirus
              (BVs) evolved ∼100 million years ago from an ancestor related to the baculovirus-nudivirus lineage but have also established many novelties due to their symbiotic lifestyle. These include the fact that BVs are transmitted only vertically as proviruses and produce replication-defective virions that package only a portion of the viral genome. Here, we studied
              Microplitis demolitor
              bracovirus (MdBV) and report that its genome exhibits three distinct patterns of DNA amplification during replication. We also identify several previously unknown features of BV genomes that correlate with these different amplification patterns.},

              Endogenous viruses form an important proportion of eukaryote genomes and a source of novel functions. How large DNA viruses integrated into a genome evolve when they confer a benefit to their host, however, remains unknown. Bracoviruses are essential for the parasitism success of parasitoid wasps, into whose genomes they integrated {\textasciitilde}103 million years ago. Here we show, from the assembly of a parasitoid wasp genome at a chromosomal scale, that bracovirus genes colonized all ten chromosomes of
              Cotesia congregata
              . Most form clusters of genes involved in particle production or parasitism success. Genomic comparison with another wasp,
              Microplitis demolitor
              , revealed that these clusters were already established {\textasciitilde}53 mya and thus belong to remarkably stable genomic structures, the architectures of which are evolutionary constrained. Transcriptomic analyses highlight temporal synchronization of viral gene expression without resulting in immune gene induction, suggesting that no conflicts remain between ancient symbiotic partners when benefits to them converge.},

              Background
              
                The most species-rich radiation of animal life in the 66 million years following the Cretaceous extinction event is that of schizophoran flies: a third of fly diversity including
                Drosophila
                fruit fly model organisms, house flies, forensic blow flies, agricultural pest flies, and many other well and poorly known true flies. Rapid diversification has hindered previous attempts to elucidate the phylogenetic relationships among major schizophoran clades. A robust phylogenetic hypothesis for the major lineages containing these 55,000 described species would be critical to understand the processes that contributed to the diversity of these flies. We use protein encoding sequence data from transcriptomes, including 3145 genes from 70 species, representing all superfamilies, to improve the resolution of this previously intractable phylogenetic challenge.
              
            
            
              Results
              
                Our results support a paraphyletic acalyptrate grade including a monophyletic Calyptratae and the monophyly of half of the acalyptrate superfamilies. The primary branching framework of Schizophora is well supported for the first time, revealing the primarily parasitic Pipunculidae and Sciomyzoidea
                stat. rev.
                as successive sister groups to the remaining Schizophora. Ephydroidea,
                Drosophila
                ’s superfamily, is the sister group of Calyptratae. Sphaeroceroidea has modest support as the sister to all non-sciomyzoid Schizophora. We define two novel lineages corroborated by morphological traits, the ‘Modified Oviscapt Clade’ containing Tephritoidea, Nerioidea, and other families, and the ‘Cleft Pedicel Clade’ containing Calyptratae, Ephydroidea, and other families. Support values remain low among a challenging subset of lineages, including Diopsidae. The placement of these families remained uncertain in both concatenated maximum likelihood and multispecies coalescent approaches. Rogue taxon removal was effective in increasing support values compared with strategies that maximise gene coverage or minimise missing data.
              
            
            
              Conclusions
              Dividing most acalyptrate fly groups into four major lineages is supported consistently across analyses. Understanding the fundamental branching patterns of schizophoran flies provides a foundation for future comparative research on the genetics, ecology, and biocontrol.},

              Background
              Metagenomics is revolutionizing the study of microorganisms and their involvement in biological, biomedical, and geochemical processes, allowing us to investigate by direct sequencing a tremendous diversity of organisms without the need for prior cultivation. Unicellular eukaryotes play essential roles in most microbial communities as chief predators, decomposers, phototrophs, bacterial hosts, symbionts, and parasites to plants and animals. Investigating their roles is therefore of great interest to ecology, biotechnology, human health, and evolution. However, the generally lower sequencing coverage, their more complex gene and genome architectures, and a lack of eukaryote-specific experimental and computational procedures have kept them on the sidelines of metagenomics.
            
            
              Results
              MetaEuk is a toolkit for high-throughput, reference-based discovery, and annotation of protein-coding genes in eukaryotic metagenomic contigs. It performs fast searches with 6-frame-translated fragments covering all possible exons and optimally combines matches into multi-exon proteins. We used a benchmark of seven diverse, annotated genomes to show that MetaEuk is highly sensitive even under conditions of low sequence similarity to the reference database. To demonstrate MetaEuk’s power to discover novel eukaryotic proteins in large-scale metagenomic data, we assembled contigs from 912 samples of the Tara Oceans project. MetaEuk predicted {\textgreater}12,000,000 protein-coding genes in 8 days on ten 16-core servers. Most of the discovered proteins are highly diverged from known proteins and originate from very sparsely sampled eukaryotic supergroups.
            
            
              Conclusion
              
                The open-source (GPLv3) MetaEuk software (
                https://github.com/soedinglab/metaeuk
                ) enables large-scale eukaryotic metagenomics through reference-based, sensitive taxonomic and functional annotation.},

As parasitoids, they are important natural enemies in most terrestrial ecological communities, particularly as natural enemies of larval Lepidoptera. Despite their diversity and ecological impact, relatively little is known about the evolution and ecology of tachinids, and what is known tends to be widely dispersed in specialized reports, journals, or texts. In this review we synthesize information on the evolutionary history, behavior, and ecology of tachinids and discuss promising directions for future research involving tachinids. We provide an overview of the phylogenetic history and geographic diversity of tachinids, examine the evolution of oviposition strategies and host associations, review known mechanisms of host location, and discuss recent studies dealing with the ecological interactions between tachinids and their hosts. In doing so, we highlight ways in which investigation of these parasitoids provides insight into such topics as biogeographic patterns of diversity, the evolution of ecological specialization, the tritrophic context of enemy-herbivore interactions, and the role of host location behavior in shaping host range.},

              Mutualistic viruses remain a rarity among known animal–microbe symbioses. Yet, several beneficial viruses have been identified within insects called parasitoid wasps. Most of these viral entities are permanent components of wasp genomes. However, a mutualistic poxvirus found within
              Diachasmimorpha longicaudata
              wasps maintains an independent genome and may therefore behave in ways more similar to cellular microbial symbionts. In this study, we discovered unique properties of viral symbiont transmission, including an evolved dependence on parasitoid wasps for virus spread among fruit fly hosts and a distinct mode of faithful virus transmission among parasitoid wasps. These findings demonstrate that certain symbiont transmission pathways have arisen independently across disparate life forms to play pivotal roles in insect biology and evolution.
            
          , 
            
              Heritable symbionts display a wide variety of transmission strategies to travel from one insect generation to the next. Parasitoid wasps, one of the most diverse insect groups, maintain several heritable associations with viruses that are beneficial for wasp survival during their development as parasites of other insects. Most of these beneficial viral entities are strictly transmitted through the wasp germline as endogenous viral elements within wasp genomes. However, a beneficial poxvirus inherited by
              Diachasmimorpha longicaudata
              wasps, known as Diachasmimorpha longicaudata entomopoxvirus (DlEPV), is not integrated into the wasp genome and therefore may employ different tactics to infect future wasp generations. Here, we demonstrated that transmission of DlEPV is primarily dependent on parasitoid wasps, since viral transmission within fruit fly hosts of the wasps was limited to injection of the virus directly into the larval fly body cavity. Additionally, we uncovered a previously undocumented form of posthatch transmission for a mutualistic virus that entails external acquisition and localization of the virus within the adult wasp venom gland. We showed that this route is extremely effective for vertical and horizontal transmission of the virus within
              D. longicaudata
              wasps. Furthermore, the beneficial phenotype provided by DlEPV during parasitism was also transmitted with perfect efficiency, indicating an effective mode of symbiont spread to the advantage of infected wasps. These results provide insight into the transmission of beneficial viruses among insects and indicate that viruses can share features with cellular microbes during their evolutionary transitions into symbionts.},

              Mutualistic viruses remain a rarity among known animal–microbe symbioses. Yet, several beneficial viruses have been identified within insects called parasitoid wasps. Most of these viral entities are permanent components of wasp genomes. However, a mutualistic poxvirus found within
              Diachasmimorpha longicaudata
              wasps maintains an independent genome and may therefore behave in ways more similar to cellular microbial symbionts. In this study, we discovered unique properties of viral symbiont transmission, including an evolved dependence on parasitoid wasps for virus spread among fruit fly hosts and a distinct mode of faithful virus transmission among parasitoid wasps. These findings demonstrate that certain symbiont transmission pathways have arisen independently across disparate life forms to play pivotal roles in insect biology and evolution.
            
          , 
            
              Heritable symbionts display a wide variety of transmission strategies to travel from one insect generation to the next. Parasitoid wasps, one of the most diverse insect groups, maintain several heritable associations with viruses that are beneficial for wasp survival during their development as parasites of other insects. Most of these beneficial viral entities are strictly transmitted through the wasp germline as endogenous viral elements within wasp genomes. However, a beneficial poxvirus inherited by
              Diachasmimorpha longicaudata
              wasps, known as Diachasmimorpha longicaudata entomopoxvirus (DlEPV), is not integrated into the wasp genome and therefore may employ different tactics to infect future wasp generations. Here, we demonstrated that transmission of DlEPV is primarily dependent on parasitoid wasps, since viral transmission within fruit fly hosts of the wasps was limited to injection of the virus directly into the larval fly body cavity. Additionally, we uncovered a previously undocumented form of posthatch transmission for a mutualistic virus that entails external acquisition and localization of the virus within the adult wasp venom gland. We showed that this route is extremely effective for vertical and horizontal transmission of the virus within
              D. longicaudata
              wasps. Furthermore, the beneficial phenotype provided by DlEPV during parasitism was also transmitted with perfect efficiency, indicating an effective mode of symbiont spread to the advantage of infected wasps. These results provide insight into the transmission of beneficial viruses among insects and indicate that viruses can share features with cellular microbes during their evolutionary transitions into symbionts.},

              The identities and the relationships of Odonteucoila Ashmead, 1903, Coneucoela Kieffer, 1909, and Trichoplasta Benoit, 1956, are discussed and the re-defined genera are described. The use of some morphological terms are defined and other new terms are proposed. Lectotypes are designated for Odonteucoila chapadae and Coneucoela brasiliensis (type-species of the respective genera); four new synonymies and fourteen new combinations are proposed. Odonteucoila auct. is considered polyphyletic. The re-defined genus Odonteucoila is placed in the Chrestosema group of genera and appears to have a strictly Neotropical distribution. Species from other parts of the world, previously assigned to Odonteucoila, are transferred to Trichoplasta, which is closely related to Rhoptromeris. The type-species of Trichoplasta, T. basilewskyi Benoit, 1956, is synonymized with T. tanganyikensis (Weld, 1944) n. comb. (originally described in Coneucoela). Coneucoela brasiliensis Kieffer, 1909, is the only recognized Coneucoela species and it is considered to belong to the Ganaspis complex of genera. A cladistic analysis of the Rhoptromeris group of genera concludes the paper.},

            Our current knowledge about nucleocytoplasmic large DNA viruses (NCLDVs) is largely derived from viral isolates that are co-cultivated with protists and algae. Here we reconstructed 2,074 NCLDV genomes from sampling sites across the globe by building on the rapidly increasing amount of publicly available metagenome data. This led to an 11-fold increase in phylogenetic diversity and a parallel 10-fold expansion in functional diversity. Analysis of 58,023 major capsid proteins from large and giant viruses using metagenomic data revealed the global distribution patterns and cosmopolitan nature of these viruses. The discovered viral genomes encoded a wide range of proteins with putative roles in photosynthesis and diverse substrate transport processes, indicating that host reprogramming is probably a common strategy in the NCLDVs. Furthermore, inferences of horizontal gene transfer connected viral lineages to diverse eukaryotic hosts. We anticipate that the global diversity of NCLDVs that we describe here will establish giant viruses—which are associated with most major eukaryotic lineages—as important players in ecosystems across Earth’s biomes.},

            Metagenomic sequencing has revolutionised our knowledge of virus diversity, with new virus sequences being reported faster than ever before. However, virus discovery from metagenomic sequencing usually depends on detectable homology: without a sufficiently close relative, so-called ‘dark’ virus sequences remain unrecognisable. An alternative approach is to use virus-identification methods that do not depend on detecting homology, such as virus recognition by host antiviral immunity. For example, virus-derived small RNAs have previously been used to propose ‘dark’ virus sequences associated with the Drosophilidae (Diptera). Here, we combine published Drosophila data with a comprehensive search of transcriptomic sequences and selected meta-transcriptomic datasets to identify a completely new lineage of segmented positive-sense single-stranded RNA viruses that we provisionally refer to as the Quenyaviruses. Each of the five segments contains a single open reading frame, with most encoding proteins showing no detectable similarity to characterised viruses, and one sharing a small number of residues with the RNA-dependent RNA polymerases of single- and double-stranded RNA viruses. Using these sequences, we identify close relatives in approximately 20 arthropods, including insects, crustaceans, spiders, and a myriapod. Using a more conserved sequence from the putative polymerase, we further identify relatives in meta-transcriptomic datasets from gut, gill, and lung tissues of vertebrates, reflecting infections of vertebrates or of their associated parasites. Our data illustrate the utility of small RNAs to detect viruses with limited sequence conservation, and provide robust evidence for a new deeply divergent and phylogenetically distinct RNA virus lineage.},

              Several species of tsetse flies can be infected by the
              Glossina pallidipes
              salivary gland hypertrophy virus (GpSGHV). Infection causes salivary gland hypertrophy and also significantly reduces the fecundity of the infected flies. To better understand the molecular basis underlying the pathogenesis of this unusual virus, we sequenced and analyzed its genome. The GpSGHV genome is a double-stranded circular DNA molecule of 190,032 bp containing 160 nonoverlapping open reading frames (ORFs), which are distributed equally on both strands with a gene density of one per 1.2 kb. It has a high A+T content of 72\%. About 3\% of the GpSGHV genome is composed of 15 sequence repeats, distributed throughout the genome. Although sharing the same morphological features (enveloped rod-shaped nucleocapsid) as baculoviruses, nudiviruses, and nimaviruses, analysis of its genome revealed that GpSGHV differs significantly from these viruses at the level of its genes. Sequence comparisons indicated that only 23\% of GpSGHV genes displayed moderate homologies to genes from other invertebrate viruses, principally baculoviruses and entomopoxviruses. Most strikingly, the GpSGHV genome encodes homologues to the four baculoviral per os infectivity factors (p74 [pif-0], pif-1, pif-2, and pif-3). The DNA polymerase encoded by GpSGHV is of type B and appears to be phylogenetically distant from all DNA polymerases encoded by large double-stranded DNA viruses. The majority of the remaining ORFs could not be assigned by sequence comparison. Furthermore, no homologues to DNA-dependent RNA polymerase subunits were detected. Taken together, these data indicate that GpSGHV is the prototype member of a novel group of insect viruses.},

	abstract = {Baculoviruses are large DNA viruses of insects that are highly pathogenic in many hosts. In the infection cycle, baculoviruses produce two types of virions. These virion phenotypes are physically and functionally distinct, and each serves a critical role in the biology of the virus. One phenotype, the occlusion-derived virus (ODV), is occluded within a crystallized protein that facilitates oral infection of the host. A large complex of at least nine ODV envelope proteins called per os infectivity factors are critically important for ODV infection of insect midgut epithelial cells. Viral egress from midgut cells is by budding to produce a second virus phenotype, the budded virus (BV). BV binds, enters, and replicates in most other tissues of the host insect. Cell recognition and entry by BV are mediated by a single major envelope glycoprotein: GP64 in some baculoviruses and F in others. Entry and egress by the two virion phenotypes occur by dramatically different mechanisms and reflect a life cycle in which ODV is specifically adapted for oral infection while BV mediates dissemination of the infection within the animal.},

              Vaccinia virus (VACV) encodes enzymes that cap the 5′ end of viral mRNAs, which enhances their stability and translation. Nevertheless, recent studies demonstrated that the VACV D10 protein (VACV-WR\_115) decaps mRNA, an enzymatic activity not previously shown to be encoded by a virus. The decapping activity of D10 is dependent on a Nudix hydrolase motif that is also present in the VACV D9 protein (VACV-WR\_114), which shares 25\% sequence identity with D10. Here, we showed that a purified recombinant VACV D9 fusion protein also decaps mRNA and that this activity was abolished by point mutations in the Nudix hydrolase motif. Decapping was specific for a methylated cap attached to RNA and resulted in the liberation of m
              7
              GDP. D9 differed from D10 in requiring a longer capped RNA substrate for optimal activity, having greater sensitivity to inhibition by uncapped RNA, and having lower sensitivity to inhibition by nucleotide cap analogs unattached to RNA. Since D9 is expressed early in infection and D10 late, we suggest that the two proteins enhance mRNA turnover and manipulate gene expression in a complementary and overlapping manner.},

            VP40, the major matrix protein of Marburg virus, is the main driving force for viral budding. Additionally, cellular factors are likely to play an important role in the release of progeny virus. In the present study, we characterized the influence of the vacuolar protein sorting (VPS) pathway on the release of virus-like particles (VLPs), which are induced by Marburg virus VP40. In the supernatants of HEK 293 cells expressing VP40, different populations of VLPs with either a vesicular or a filamentous morphology were detected. While the filaments were almost completely composed of VP40, the vesicular particles additionally contained considerable amounts of cellular proteins. In contrast to that in the vesicles, the VP40 in the filaments was regularly organized, probably inducing the elimination of cellular proteins from the released VLPs. Vesicular particles were observed in the supernatants of cells even in the absence of VP40. Mutation of the late-domain motif in VP40 resulted in reduced release of filamentous particles, and likewise, inhibition of the VPS pathway by expression of a dominant-negative (DN) form of VPS4 inhibited the release of filamentous particles. In contrast, the release of vesicular particles did not respond significantly to the expression of DN VPS4. Like the budding of VLPs, the budding of Marburg virus particles was partially inhibited by the expression of DN VPS4. While the release of VLPs from VP40-expressing cells is a valuable tool with which to investigate the budding of Marburg virus particles, it is important to separate filamentous VLPs from vesicular particles, which contain many cellular proteins and use a different budding mechanism.},

            Many viruses use a molecular motor to pump DNA into a preformed protein shell called the capsid, a process that is essential for the formation of infectious virus particles. The ATPase machine powering this process is the strongest known biological motor. However, the structure and mechanism of this motor are unknown. Here, we derive a structural model of the ATPase assembly using a combination of X-ray crystallography, small-angle X-ray scattering, molecular modeling, and biochemical data. We identify residues critical for ATP hydrolysis and DNA binding, and derive a mechanistic model for the translocation of DNA into the viral capsid. Our studies introduce a model for ATPase assembly and illustrate how DNA is pumped with high force.

            Many viruses package their genomes into procapsids using an ATPase machine that is among the most powerful known biological motors. However, how this motor couples ATP hydrolysis to DNA translocation is still unknown. Here, we introduce a model system with unique properties for studying motor structure and mechanism. We describe crystal structures of the packaging motor ATPase domain that exhibit nucleotide-dependent conformational changes involving a large rotation of an entire subdomain. We also identify the arginine finger residue that catalyzes ATP hydrolysis in a neighboring motor subunit, illustrating that previous models for motor structure need revision. Our findings allow us to derive a structural model for the motor ring, which we validate using small-angle X-ray scattering and comparisons with previously published data. We illustrate the model’s predictive power by identifying the motor’s DNA-binding and assembly motifs. Finally, we integrate our results to propose a mechanistic model for DNA translocation by this molecular machine.},

Here, we present crystal structures of Rea1-MIDAS, the conserved domain at the tip of the flexible Rea1 tail, alone and in complex with its substrate ligands, the UBL domains of Rsa4 or Ytm1. These complexes have structural similarity to integrin α-subunit domains when bound to extracellular matrix ligands, which for integrin biology is a key determinant for force-bearing cell–cell adhesion. However, the presence of additional motifs equips Rea1-MIDAS for its tasks in ribosome maturation. One loop insert cofunctions as an NLS and to activate the mechanochemical Rea1 cycle, whereas an additional β-hairpin provides an anchor to hold the ligand UBL domains in place. Our data show the versatility of the MIDAS fold for mechanical force transmission in processes as varied as integrin-mediated cell adhesion and mechanochemical removal of assembly factors from pre-ribosomes.},

These triple-membrane particles, termed intracellular enveloped virions (IEVs), are released from infected cells by fusion. Whereas the wrapping double membrane is thought to be derived from virus-modified trans-Golgi or early endosomal cisternae, the cellular factors that regulate virus wrapping remain largely undefined. To identify cell factors required for this process the prototypic poxvirus, vaccinia virus (VACV), was subjected to an RNAi screen directed against cellular membrane-trafficking proteins. Focusing on the endosomal sorting complexes required for transport (ESCRT), we demonstrate that ESCRT-III and VPS4 are required for packaging of virus into multivesicular bodies (MVBs). EM-based characterization of MVB-IEVs showed that they account for half of IEV production indicating that MVBs are a second major source of VACV wrapping membrane. These data support a model whereby, in addition to cisternae-based wrapping, VACV hijacks ESCRT-mediated MVB formation to facilitate virus egress and spread.},

              Background
              Parasitic insects are well-known biological control agents for arthropod pests worldwide. They are capable of regulating their host’s physiology, development and behaviour. However, many of the molecular mechanisms involved in host-parasitoid interaction remain unknown.
            
            
              Results
              
                We sequenced the genomes of two parasitic wasps (
                Cotesia vestalis
                , and
                Diadromus collaris
                ) that parasitize the diamondback moth
                Plutella xylostella
                using Illumina and Pacbio sequencing platforms. Genome assembly using SOAPdenovo produced a 178 Mb draft genome for
                C. vestalis
                and a 399 Mb draft genome for
                D. collaris
                . A total set that contained 11,278 and 15,328 protein-coding genes for
                C. vestalis
                and
                D. collaris
                , respectively, were predicted using evidence (homology-based and transcriptome-based) and de novo prediction methodology. Phylogenetic analysis showed that the braconid
                C. vestalis
                and the ichneumonid
                D. collaris
                diverged approximately 124 million years ago. These two wasps exhibit gene gains and losses that in some cases reflect their shared life history as parasitic wasps and in other cases are unique to particular species. Gene families with functions in development, nutrient acquisition from hosts, and metabolism have expanded in each wasp species, while genes required for biosynthesis of some amino acids and steroids have been lost, since these nutrients can be directly obtained from the host. Both wasp species encode a relative higher number of neprilysins (NEPs) thus far reported in arthropod genomes while several genes encoding immune-related proteins and detoxification enzymes were lost in both wasp genomes.
              
            
            
              Conclusions
              
                We present the annotated genome sequence of two parasitic wasps
                C. vestalis
                and
                D. collaris
                , which parasitize a common host, the diamondback moth,
                P. xylostella
                . These data will provide a fundamental source for studying the mechanism of host control and will be used in parasitoid comparative genomics to study the origin and diversification of the parasitic lifestyle.},

              For insects, the prevalence of numerous vertically transmitted viruses can be high in their host populations. These viruses often have few, if any, pathological effects on their hosts, and consequently, many of them can remain unnoticed for long periods, despite their potential role in the evolution of the host phenotype. Some females of
              Leptopilina boulardi
              , a solitary parasitoid of
              Drosophila
              larvae, are infected by an inherited virus (LbFV) that manipulates the behavior of the wasp by increasing its tendency to lay eggs in a host that is already parasitized (superparasitism). This behavioral alteration allows horizontal transmission of the virus within superparasitized
              Drosophila
              larvae. Using suppressive subtractive hybridization with infected and uninfected lines, we identified one putative viral sequence. Based on this sequence, we developed a simple PCR test. We tested the correlation between the superparasitism phenotype and PCR amplification of the putative viral marker using several experimental conditions (including horizontal transfers) and several parasitoid genotypes. All of the results revealed that there was a perfect match between the superparasitism phenotype and the amplification profile, which validated use of the molecular marker as a tool to track the presence of the virus and provided the first genomic data for this fascinating virus. The results also show that there was very efficient horizontal and vertical transmission of LbFV, which probably explains its high prevalence in the French populations that we sampled (67 and 70\% of infected females). This manipulative virus is likely to play a major role in the ecology and evolution of its parasitoid host.},

            While long-read sequencing allows for the complete assembly of bacterial genomes, long-read assemblies contain a variety of errors. Here, we present Trycycler, a tool which produces a consensus assembly from multiple input assemblies of the same genome. Benchmarking showed that Trycycler assemblies contained fewer errors than assemblies constructed with a single tool. Post-assembly polishing further reduced errors and Trycycler+polishing assemblies were the most accurate genomes in our study. As Trycycler requires manual intervention, its output is not deterministic. However, we demonstrated that multiple users converge on similar assemblies that are consistently more accurate than those produced by automated assembly tools.},

            We present BlobTools, a modular command-line solution for visualisation, quality control and taxonomic partitioning of genome datasets. Using guanine+cytosine content of sequences, read coverage in sequencing libraries and taxonomy of sequence similarity matches, BlobTools can assist in primary partitioning of data, leading to improved assemblies, and screening of final assemblies for potential contaminants. 
            Through simulated paired-end read dataset,s containing a mixture of metazoan and bacterial taxa, we illustrate the main BlobTools workflow and suggest useful parameters for taxonomic partitioning of low-complexity metagenome assemblies.},

	abstract = {Abstract
            In phylogenetic inference, we commonly use models of substitution which assume that sequence evolution is stationary, reversible, and homogeneous (SRH). Although the use of such models is often criticized, the extent of SRH violations and their effects on phylogenetic inference of tree topologies and edge lengths are not well understood. Here, we introduce and apply the maximal matched-pairs tests of homogeneity to assess the scale and impact of SRH model violations on 3,572 partitions from 35 published phylogenetic data sets. We show that roughly one-quarter of all the partitions we analyzed (23.5\%) reject the SRH assumptions, and that for 25\% of data sets, tree topologies inferred from all partitions differ significantly from topologies inferred using the subset of partitions that do not reject the SRH assumptions. This proportion increases when comparing trees inferred using the subset of partitions that rejects the SRH assumptions, to those inferred from partitions that do not reject the SRH assumptions. These results suggest that the extent and effects of model violation in phylogenetics may be substantial. They highlight the importance of testing for model violations and possibly excluding partitions that violate models prior to tree reconstruction. Our results also suggest that further effort in developing models that do not require SRH assumptions could lead to large improvements in the accuracy of phylogenomic inference. The scripts necessary to perform the analysis are available in https://github.com/roblanf/SRHtests, and the new tests we describe are available as a new option in IQ-TREE (http://www.iqtree.org).},

              Background
              SAMtools and BCFtools are widely used programs for processing and analysing high-throughput sequencing data. They include tools for file format conversion and manipulation, sorting, querying, statistics, variant calling, and effect analysis amongst other methods.
            
            
              Findings
              The first version appeared online 12 years ago and has been maintained and further developed ever since, with many new features and improvements added over the years. The SAMtools and BCFtools packages represent a unique collection of tools that have been used in numerous other software projects and countless genomic pipelines.
            
            
              Conclusion
              Both SAMtools and BCFtools are freely available on GitHub under the permissive MIT licence, free for both non-commercial and commercial use. Both packages have been installed \&gt;1 million times via Bioconda. The source code and documentation are available from https://www.htslib.org.},

              Summary
              MMseqs2 taxonomy is a new tool to assign taxonomic labels to metagenomic contigs. It extracts all possible protein fragments from each contig, quickly retains those that can contribute to taxonomic annotation, assigns them with robust labels and determines the contig’s taxonomic identity by weighted voting. Its fragment extraction step is suitable for the analysis of all domains of life. MMseqs2 taxonomy is 2–18× faster than state-of-the-art tools and also contains new modules for creating and manipulating taxonomic reference databases as well as reporting and visualizing taxonomic assignments.
            
            
              Availability and implementation
              MMseqs2 taxonomy is part of the MMseqs2 free open-source software package available for Linux, macOS and Windows at https://mmseqs.com.

              6,7
              . Structural coverage is bottlenecked by the months to years of painstaking effort required to determine a single protein structure. Accurate computational approaches are needed to address this gap and to enable large-scale structural bioinformatics. Predicting the three-dimensional structure that a protein will adopt based solely on its amino acid sequence—the structure prediction component of the ‘protein folding problem’

Here we provide the first computational method that can regularly predict protein structures with atomic accuracy even in cases in which no similar structure is known. We validated an entirely redesigned version of our neural network-based model, AlphaFold, in the challenging 14th Critical Assessment of protein Structure Prediction (CASP14)
              15
              , demonstrating accuracy competitive with experimental structures in a majority of cases and greatly outperforming other methods.

            DeepMind presented notably accurate predictions at the recent 14th Critical Assessment of Structure Prediction (CASP14) conference. We explored network architectures that incorporate related ideas and obtained the best performance with a three-track network in which information at the one-dimensional (1D) sequence level, the 2D distance map level, and the 3D coordinate level is successively transformed and integrated. The three-track network produces structure predictions with accuracies approaching those of DeepMind in CASP14, enables the rapid solution of challenging x-ray crystallography and cryo–electron microscopy structure modeling problems, and provides insights into the functions of proteins of currently unknown structure. The network also enables rapid generation of accurate protein-protein complex models from sequence information alone, short-circuiting traditional approaches that require modeling of individual subunits followed by docking. We make the method available to the scientific community to speed biological research.},

              The rapid increase in the number of proteins in sequence databases and the diversity of their functions challenge computational approaches for automated function prediction. Here, we introduce DeepFRI, a Graph Convolutional Network for predicting protein functions by leveraging sequence features extracted from a protein language model and protein structures. It outperforms current leading methods and sequence-based Convolutional Neural Networks and scales to the size of current sequence repositories. Augmenting the training set of experimental structures with homology models allows us to significantly expand the number of predictable functions. DeepFRI has significant de-noising capability, with only a minor drop in performance when experimental structures are replaced by protein models. Class activation mapping allows function predictions at an unprecedented resolution, allowing site-specific annotations at the residue-level in an automated manner. We show the utility and high performance of our method by annotating structures from the PDB and SWISS-MODEL, making several new confident function predictions. DeepFRI is available as a webserver at

Genome comparisons show that orthologous relationships with genes from taxonomically distant species can be established for the majority of the genes from each sequenced genome.

            The nucleocytoplasmic large DNA viruses (NCLDVs, phylum Nucleocytoviricota) infect vertebrates, invertebrates, algae, amoebae, and other unicellular organisms across supergroups of eukaryotes and in various ecosystems. The expanding collection of their genome sequences has revolutionized our view of virus genome size and coding capacity. Phylogenetic trees based on a few core genes are commonly used as a model to understand their evolution. However, the tree topology can differ between analyses, and the vast majority of encoded genes might not share a common evolutionary history. To explore the whole-genome variation and evolution of NCLDVs, we dissected their gene contents using clustering, network, and comparative analyses. Our updated core-gene tree served as a framework to classify NCLDVs into families and intrafamilial lineages, but networks of individual genomes and family pangenomes showed patterns of gene sharing that contradict with the tree topology, in particular at higher taxonomic levels. Clustering of NCLDV genomes revealed variable granularity and degrees of gene sharing within each family, which cannot be inferred from the tree. At the level of NCLDV families, a correlation exists between gene content variation, but not core-gene sequence divergence, and host supergroup diversity. In addition, there is significantly higher gene sharing between divergent viruses that infect similar host types. The identified shared genes would be a useful resource for further functional analyses of NCLDV–host interactions. Overall this study provides a comprehensive view of gene repertoire variation in NCLDVs at different taxonomic levels, as well as a novel approach to studying the extremely diverse giant virus genomes.},

	abstract = {ABSTRACT
            Virus genomes are prone to extensive gene loss, gain, and exchange and share no universal genes. Therefore, in a broad-scale study of virus evolution, gene and genome network analyses can complement traditional phylogenetics. We performed an exhaustive comparative analysis of the genomes of double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) viruses by using the bipartite network approach and found a robust hierarchical modularity in the dsDNA virosphere. Bipartite networks consist of two classes of nodes, with nodes in one class, in this case genomes, being connected via nodes of the second class, in this case genes. Such a network can be partitioned into modules that combine nodes from both classes. The bipartite network of dsDNA viruses includes 19 modules that form 5 major and 3 minor supermodules. Of these modules, 11 include tailed bacteriophages, reflecting the diversity of this largest group of viruses. The module analysis quantitatively validates and refines previously proposed nontrivial evolutionary relationships. An expansive supermodule combines the large and giant viruses of the putative order “Megavirales” with diverse moderate-sized viruses and related mobile elements. All viruses in this supermodule share a distinct morphogenetic tool kit with a double jelly roll major capsid protein. Herpesviruses and tailed bacteriophages comprise another supermodule, held together by a distinct set of morphogenetic proteins centered on the HK97-like major capsid protein. Together, these two supermodules cover the great majority of currently known dsDNA viruses. We formally identify a set of 14 viral hallmark genes that comprise the hubs of the network and account for most of the intermodule connections.
            
              IMPORTANCE
              Viruses and related mobile genetic elements are the dominant biological entities on earth, but their evolution is not sufficiently understood and their classification is not adequately developed. The key reason is the characteristic high rate of virus evolution that involves not only sequence change but also extensive gene loss, gain, and exchange. Therefore, in the study of virus evolution on a large scale, traditional phylogenetic approaches have limited applicability and have to be complemented by gene and genome network analyses. We applied state-of-the art methods of such analysis to reveal robust hierarchical modularity in the genomes of double-stranded DNA viruses. Some of the identified modules combine highly diverse viruses infecting bacteria, archaea, and eukaryotes, in support of previous hypotheses on direct evolutionary relationships between viruses from the three domains of cellular life. We formally identify a set of 14 viral hallmark genes that hold together the genomic network.

              Summary
              MMseqs2 taxonomy is a new tool to assign taxonomic labels to metagenomic contigs. It extracts all possible protein fragments from each contig, quickly retains those that can contribute to taxonomic annotation, assigns them with robust labels and determines the contig’s taxonomic identity by weighted voting. Its fragment extraction step is suitable for the analysis of all domains of life. MMseqs2 taxonomy is 2–18× faster than state-of-the-art tools and also contains new modules for creating and manipulating taxonomic reference databases as well as reporting and visualizing taxonomic assignments.
            
            
              Availability and implementation
              MMseqs2 taxonomy is part of the MMseqs2 free open-source software package available for Linux, macOS and Windows at https://mmseqs.com.

              Poxviruses are nucleocytoplasmic large DNA viruses encompassing two subfamilies, the
              Chordopoxvirinae
              and the
              Entomopoxvirinae
              , infecting vertebrates and insects, respectively. While chordopoxvirus genomics have been widely studied, only two entomopoxvirus (EPV) genomes have been entirely sequenced. We report the genome sequences of four EPVs of the
              Betaentomopoxvirus
              genus infecting the Lepidoptera:
              Adoxophyes honmai
              EPV (AHEV),
              Choristoneura biennis
              EPV (CBEV),
              Choristoneura rosaceana
              EPV (CREV), and
              Mythimna separata
              EPV (MySEV). The genomes are 80\% AT rich, are 228 to 307 kbp long, and contain 247 to 334 open reading frames (ORFs). Most genes are homologous to those of
              Amsacta moorei
              entomopoxvirus and encode several protein families repeated in tandem in terminal regions. Some genomes also encode proteins of unknown functions with similarity to those of other insect viruses. Comparative genomic analyses highlight a high colinearity among the lepidopteran EPV genomes and little gene order conservation with other poxvirus genomes. As with previously sequenced EPVs, the genomes include a relatively conserved central region flanked by inverted terminal repeats. Protein clustering identified 104 core EPV genes. Among betaentomopoxviruses, 148 core genes were found in relatively high synteny, pointing to low genomic diversity. Whole-genome and spheroidin gene phylogenetic analyses showed that the lepidopteran EPVs group closely in a monophyletic lineage, corroborating their affiliation with the
              Betaentomopoxvirus
              genus as well as a clear division of the EPVs according to the orders of insect hosts (Lepidoptera, Coleoptera, and Orthoptera). This suggests an ancient coevolution of EPVs with their insect hosts and the need to revise the current EPV taxonomy to separate orthopteran EPVs from the lepidopteran-specific betaentomopoxviruses so as to form a new genus.},

              Yoka poxvirus was isolated almost four decades ago from a mosquito pool in the Central African Republic. Its classification as a poxvirus is based solely upon the morphology of virions visualized by electron microscopy. Here we describe sequencing of the Yoka poxvirus genome using a combination of Roche/454 and Illumina next-generation sequencing technologies. A single consensus contig of ∼175 kb in length that encodes 186 predicted genes was generated. Multiple methods were used to show that Yoka poxvirus is most closely related to viruses in the
              Orthopoxvirus
              genus, but it is clearly distinct from previously described poxviruses. Collectively, the phylogenetic and genomic sequence analyses suggest that Yoka poxvirus is the prototype member of a new genus in the family

Our large-scale scan of complete and draft bacterial and archaeal genomes in the NCBI RefSeq database reveals that 2250 genomes are contaminated by human sequence. The contaminant sequences derive primarily from high-copy human repeat regions, which themselves are not adequately represented in the current human reference genome, GRCh38. The absence of the sequences from the human assembly offers a likely explanation for their presence in bacterial assemblies. In some cases, the contaminating contigs have been erroneously annotated as containing protein-coding sequences, which over time have propagated to create spurious protein “families” across multiple prokaryotic and eukaryotic genomes. As a result, 3437 spurious protein entries are currently present in the widely used nr and TrEMBL protein databases. We report here an extensive list of contaminant sequences in bacterial genome assemblies and the proteins associated with them. We found that nearly all contaminants occurred in small contigs in draft genomes, which suggests that filtering out small contigs from draft genome assemblies may mitigate the issue of contamination while still keeping nearly all of the genuine genomic sequences.},

This knowledge gap limits the potential of venom as a model trait in evolutionary biology. Here, we summarize the taxonomic and functional diversity of animal venoms and relate this to what is known about venom system morphology, venom modulation, and venom pharmacology, with the aim of drawing attention to the importance of these largely neglected aspects of venom research. We find that animals have evolved venoms at least 101 independent times and that venoms play at least 11 distinct ecological roles in addition to predation, defense, and feeding. Comparisons of different venom systems suggest that morphology strongly influences how venoms achieve these functions, and hence is an important consideration for understanding the molecular evolution of venoms and their toxins. Our findings also highlight the need for more holistic studies of venom systems and the toxins they contain. Greater knowledge of behavior, morphology, and ecologically relevant toxin pharmacology will improve our understanding of the evolution of venoms and their toxins, and likely facilitate exploration of their potential as sources of molecular tools and therapeutic and agrochemical lead compounds.},

              Venom composition of parasitoid wasps attracts increasing interest – notably molecules ensuring parasitism success on arthropod pests – but its variation within and among taxa is not yet understood. We have identified here the main venom proteins of two braconid wasps,
              Psyttalia lounsburyi
              (two strains from South Africa and Kenya) and
              P. concolor,
              olive fruit fly parasitoids that differ in host range. Among the shared abundant proteins, we found a GH1 β-glucosidase and a family of leucine-rich repeat (LRR) proteins. Olive is extremely rich in glycoside compounds that are hydrolyzed by β-glucosidases into defensive toxic products in response to phytophagous insect attacks. Assuming that
              Psyttalia
              host larvae sequester ingested glycosides, the injected venom GH1 β-glucosidase could induce the release of toxic compounds, thus participating in parasitism success by weakening the host. Venom LRR proteins are similar to truncated Toll-like receptors and may possibly scavenge the host immunity. The abundance of one of these LRR proteins in the venom of only one of the two
              P. lounsburyi
              strains evidences intraspecific variation in venom composition. Altogether, venom intra- and inter-specific variation in
              Psyttalia
              spp. were much lower than previously reported in the
              Leptopilina
              genus (Figitidae), suggesting it might depend upon the parasitoid taxa.},

              . They infect a wide range of monocots and dicots. Some viruses cause economically important diseases of tropical and subtropical crops. Transmission occurs through insect vectors (aphids, mealybugs, leafhoppers, lace bugs) and grafting. Activation of infectious endogenous viral elements occurs in
              Musa balbisiana
              ,
              Petunia hybrida
              and
              Nicotiana edwardsonii
              . However, most endogenous caulimovirids are not infectious. This is a summary of the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV) Report on the family
              Caulimoviridae,
